      "answer": "The cheapest alternatives are the open-source options: Flux.1 and Stable Diffusion. Both are completely free to use, modify, and deploy locally, with no subscription fees or usage limits. Flux.1 offers exceptional prompt adherence and quality as an open-weight model, while Stable Diffusion provides massive customization through its ecosystem of community models. However, these 'free' options require technical expertise for setup and local hardware for operation, so the true cost includes time and computational resources rather than direct payments."
