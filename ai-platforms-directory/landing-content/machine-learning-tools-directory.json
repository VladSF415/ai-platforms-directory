    {
      "question": "What's the difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch?",
      "answer": "TensorFlow (Google) emphasizes production deployment with TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite, and TensorFlow.js. It has a steeper learning curve but excels at scale. PyTorch (Meta) prioritizes research and prototyping with a more intuitive, Pythonic API. It's easier to debug and customize. In 2026, both are production-ready; choose TensorFlow for Google Cloud integration or PyTorch for flexibility and active research. Many teams use both: PyTorch for research, TensorFlow for deployment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need MLOps tools for small ML projects?",
      "answer": "MLOps becomes valuable when you have multiple models, regular retraining, or team collaboration. For solo experiments or one-off models, Jupyter notebooks suffice. Once you deploy to production, need reproducibility, or have 2+ people working on ML, adopt at minimum: version control (Git), experiment tracking (MLflow), and model registry. Full MLOps (CI/CD, monitoring, automated retraining) is overkill for small projects but essential for production ML systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use AutoML or build models manually?",
      "answer": "AutoML is excellent for: establishing baselines, rapid prototyping, and scenarios where ML expertise is limited. It handles 80% of tabular data problems well. Manual ML excels when: you need custom architectures, have domain-specific requirements, require explainability, or want to squeeze out the last 5% of performance. Best practice: start with AutoML to establish a baseline, then invest in manual optimization only if necessary. For production systems, human oversight remains critical regardless of AutoML usage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ML tools are best for beginners?",
      "answer": "Start with: scikit-learn (traditional ML), Google Colab or Jupyter (experimentation), Pandas (data manipulation), and Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization). This stack requires minimal setup and covers fundamental ML concepts. Progress to: PyTorch or TensorFlow (deep learning), MLflow (experiment tracking), and Streamlit (model deployment). Avoid complex MLOps tools until you understand basic ML workflows. Online courses using these tools accelerate learning through hands-on practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I choose between cloud ML platforms (AWS, Google, Azure)?",
      "answer": "Consider: (1) Existing cloud infrastructure—use the platform you're already on for easier integration. (2) Framework preference—Google Cloud favors TensorFlow, AWS is framework-agnostic, Azure integrates well with Microsoft stack. (3) Specific features—Google excels at AutoML and TPUs, AWS offers broadest services, Azure provides enterprise integrations. (4) Pricing—compare costs for your usage patterns. Most teams benefit from multi-cloud strategies: develop on one platform, deploy on multiple for redundancy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are feature stores and do I need one?",
      "answer": "Feature stores centralize feature definitions, ensuring consistency between training and production (avoiding training-serving skew). They provide: feature reusability across models, point-in-time correctness for time-series data, and standardized feature engineering. You need a feature store when: you have multiple models sharing features, struggle with feature consistency, or spend significant time re-engineering features. For teams with <3 models or simple feature pipelines, the overhead may not be worthwhile. As your ML practice matures, feature stores become increasingly valuable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How important is GPU support when choosing ML tools?",
      "answer": "Critical for deep learning (CNNs, Transformers, LLMs) where GPUs provide 10-100x speedup. Not important for traditional ML (decision trees, linear models) which run efficiently on CPUs. All major frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) support GPUs. Consider: training time (GPUs dramatically reduce it), cost (GPU hours are expensive), and inference (often CPU-sufficient for many models). For development, cloud GPUs (Colab, Paperspace) are cost-effective. For production, evaluate CPU vs GPU inference based on latency requirements and request volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the role of model monitoring in production ML?",
      "answer": "Models degrade over time due to data drift (input distribution changes) and concept drift (relationship between inputs and outputs changes). Model monitoring detects: accuracy degradation, prediction distribution shifts, feature distribution changes, and data quality issues. It alerts you when: models need retraining, data pipelines break, or biases emerge. Essential for production ML where stale models create business risk. Tools like Arize, WhyLabs, and Evidently AI automate monitoring. Without monitoring, models fail silently, causing poor user experiences or incorrect business decisions."
