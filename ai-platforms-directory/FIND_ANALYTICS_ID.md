# How to Find Your Google Analytics Measurement ID

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to Google Analytics**
   - Visit: https://analytics.google.com

2. **Select Your Property**
   - Click on "Admin" (gear icon at bottom left)
   - Select "AI Platforms List" property

3. **Get Measurement ID**
   - Click "Data Streams" under Property column
   - Click on your web stream (aiplatformslist.com)
   - Copy the **Measurement ID** (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

## What I Need From You:

Just tell me your **Measurement ID** that starts with `G-` and I'll add it to the site immediately.

Example format: `G-ABC123XYZ`

## Alternative: Check Old Firebase Site

If you can't access Google Analytics, you can:

1. Try to view source of old Firebase site (if still accessible)
2. Look for a script tag with `gtag` or `analytics`
3. Find the ID in the format `G-XXXXXXXXXX`

Once you give me the ID, I'll add:
- Google Analytics 4 (GA4) tracking
- Page view tracking for all pages
- Event tracking for platform visits
- Submit form tracking
