  "introduction": "Stroke remains a leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide, with every minute of treatment delay resulting in significant neurological damage. Healthcare AI platforms are transforming stroke care by reducing time-to-diagnosis and enabling rapid care coordination. This guide explores verified FDA-cleared AI platforms making measurable improvements in acute stroke care.",

    {
      "heading": "The Clinical Impact of Time in Stroke Care",
      "content": "In acute ischemic stroke, the adage 'time is brain' emphasizes that rapid diagnosis and treatment directly correlate with patient outcomes. Healthcare AI platforms analyze imaging studies in seconds, enabling immediate triage decisions. Peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that AI-powered stroke detection systems reduce door-to-puncture times, a critical metric in endovascular thrombectomy."

      "heading": "FDA-Cleared AI Platforms in Stroke Detection",
      "content": "Viz.ai operates one of the most established FDA-cleared care coordination platforms for acute stroke. The platform analyzes CT imaging to identify large vessel occlusions (LVOs) and coordinates rapid communication between radiology and neurology teams. Healthcare systems using these platforms report improvements in the door-to-transfer metric, which measures time from hospital arrival to transfer for specialized care."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Real-World Implementation and Outcomes",
      "content": "Multiple healthcare systems have published peer-reviewed studies on AI integration in stroke care. These studies typically examine metrics including door-to-puncture time, Modified Rankin Scores (patient functional outcomes), and imaging turnaround times. The evidence suggests that AI-assisted workflows improve efficiency while maintaining diagnostic accuracy."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Integration Considerations for Healthcare Facilities",
      "content": "Implementing AI in stroke care requires careful planning around existing HIPAA-compliant infrastructure, radiology technician workflows, and neurology protocols. Most FDA-cleared platforms integrate with existing PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) systems. Hospital IT teams should evaluate whether solutions are cloud-based or require on-premise infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "heading": "Clinical Validation and Compliance Standards",
      "content": "FDA clearance indicates that platforms meet regulatory standards for medical devices. Healthcare facilities should verify FDA clearance status and review peer-reviewed publications demonstrating clinical efficacy. Additionally, all systems must maintain HIPAA compliance for patient data handling and include appropriate disclaimers about clinical decision-making."

    "Healthcare AI can reduce time-to-diagnosis in acute stroke care, with direct implications for patient outcomes",
    "FDA-cleared platforms have demonstrated improvements in door-to-puncture times and other critical care metrics",
    "Implementation requires careful integration with existing hospital workflows and imaging systems",
    "Peer-reviewed evidence supports AI-assisted stroke detection as an adjunct to clinical expertise",
    "HIPAA compliance and clear clinical workflows are essential for successful implementation"
  ],
  "conclusion": "As healthcare AI matures in 2026, the evidence increasingly supports AI-powered care coordination in acute care settings. For hospitals seeking to improve stroke care outcomes, FDA-cleared platforms offer validated tools that complement existing clinical expertise. Success requires careful implementation planning, staff training, and ongoing performance monitoring.",
