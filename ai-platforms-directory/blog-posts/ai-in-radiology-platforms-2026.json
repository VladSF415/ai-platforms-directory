      "heading": "Clinical Validation and Regulatory Landscape",
      "content": "Leading radiology AI platforms typically operate under FDA 510(k) clearances as Class II medical devices or as laboratory-developed tests through CLIA-certified laboratories. Clinical validation often includes peer-reviewed studies demonstrating impact on workflow efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, or patient outcomes. However, validation status varies by platform and specific application. Healthcare institutions should verify current regulatory status and clinical evidence for each platform's intended use case, as regulatory pathways and clinical evidence continue to evolve alongside technological advancements."
