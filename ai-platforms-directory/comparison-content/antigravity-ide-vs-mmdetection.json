        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "MMDetection (computer vision) is MMDetection is an open-source object detection toolbox and benchmark built on PyTorch, designed to provide a unified and modular framework for training, evaluating, and deploying a wide variety of detection algorithms. Its key capabilities include supporting numerous state-of-the-art models for object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, all while emphasizing high performance and code reusability. It is uniquely positioned due to its comprehensive model zoo, rigorous benchmarking, and its role as a core component of the broader OpenMMLab ecosystem for computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, panoptic-segmentation."
