        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Google Cloud Vision API (computer vision) is Google Cloud Vision API is a fully managed, pre-trained machine learning service that enables developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into applications without requiring deep ML expertise. Its key capabilities include detecting objects, faces, landmarks, logos, and text (OCR) within images, as well as filtering explicit content and generating image metadata. It uniquely leverages Google's massive-scale, proprietary datasets and research to deliver high-accuracy, production-ready models accessible via a simple REST API, making it a top choice for enterprises and developers needing reliable, scalable computer vision.. Users choose it for image-analysis, optical-character-recognition, object-detection."
