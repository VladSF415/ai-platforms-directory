        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "ONNX Runtime (ml frameworks) is ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. It accelerates model execution across diverse hardware (CPUs, GPUs, specialized accelerators) via a unified interface to vendor-specific libraries. Its unique value lies in enabling framework-agnostic, production-ready deployment with maximal hardware utilization through a flexible provider system.. Users choose it for model-inference, cross-platform, hardware-acceleration."
