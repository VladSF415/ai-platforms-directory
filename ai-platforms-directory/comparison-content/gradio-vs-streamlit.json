        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. It's known for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool.",
        "Streamlit (ml frameworks) is Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to transform data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes, without requiring front-end web development skills. Its key capability is turning Python scripts into interactive apps with widgets, visualizations, and data caching through a simple declarative API. What makes it unique is its rapid development cycle with hot-reloading, a growing ecosystem of community-built components, and seamless integration with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.. Users choose it for python-framework, data-apps, prototyping."
