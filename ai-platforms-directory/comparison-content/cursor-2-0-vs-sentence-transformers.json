      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor 2.0's feature set revolves around AI-enhanced coding: multi-agent orchestration within the editor enables different AI agents to handle specific tasks like code generation, debugging, and testing simultaneously. Autonomous repository exploration allows the system to understand and refactor codebases at scale. Integrated CI/CD and deployment previews streamline the development pipeline, while real-time collaborative AI pair programming enables teams to work together with AI assistance seamlessly.\n\nSentence Transformers specializes in embedding generation and semantic operations: its pre-trained and fine-tuned models support 100+ languages, with easy APIs for encoding text into high-dimensional vectors. Built-in semantic similarity functions (cosine similarity, dot product) enable immediate similarity calculations, while support for asymmetric semantic search handles query-passage matching scenarios. Integration with vector databases (FAISS, Annoy, Qdrant) and a training framework for custom datasets provide flexibility, and image-text embedding models (CLIP, ALIGN) extend capabilities beyond text."
