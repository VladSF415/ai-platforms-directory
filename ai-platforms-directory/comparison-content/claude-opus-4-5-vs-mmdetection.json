        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "MMDetection (computer vision) is MMDetection is an open-source object detection toolbox and benchmark built on PyTorch, designed to provide a unified and modular framework for training, evaluating, and deploying a wide variety of detection algorithms. Its key capabilities include supporting numerous state-of-the-art models for object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, all while emphasizing high performance and code reusability. It is uniquely positioned due to its comprehensive model zoo, rigorous benchmarking, and its role as a core component of the broader OpenMMLab ecosystem for computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, panoptic-segmentation."
