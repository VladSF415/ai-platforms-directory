        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
