        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. It's known for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings.",
        "Triton Inference Server (ml frameworks) is NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is an open-source, high-performance inference serving software designed to deploy, run, and scale AI models from any framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT) on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure. It uniquely enables production AI workloads by providing features like dynamic batching, concurrent model execution, and model ensembles to maximize throughput and utilization. Its primary audience is ML engineers and DevOps teams building scalable, multi-framework inference pipelines in data centers, cloud, or edge environments.. Users choose it for NVIDIA, Model Serving, Inference Optimization."
