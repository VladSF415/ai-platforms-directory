      "strengths": [
        "Comprehensive care coordination platform beyond pure image analysis",
        "Integration of multiple data types including imaging and cardiovascular monitoring",
        "Focus on time-sensitive conditions requiring rapid clinical response",
        "Multiple FDA-cleared algorithms across different modalities"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Platform complexity may require more extensive implementation and training",
        "Clinical utility depends on institutional workflow adoption",
        "Algorithm performance varies by specific clinical indication and patient population"
      ],
      "bestFor": "Health systems seeking an integrated care coordination platform for time-sensitive diagnoses, particularly for stroke and cardiovascular conditions requiring rapid multidisciplinary response."
