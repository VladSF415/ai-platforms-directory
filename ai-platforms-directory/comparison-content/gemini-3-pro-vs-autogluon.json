        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "AutoGluon (workflow automation) is AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML toolkit developed by Amazon that automates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment. Its key capabilities include robust automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling, with specialized support for tabular, text, and image data. It uniquely targets both practitioners and researchers by offering state-of-the-art performance 'out-of-the-box' while remaining extensible for custom modeling tasks, significantly reducing the expertise and time required to build high-quality ML models.. Users choose it for automl, amazon-aws, tabular-data."
