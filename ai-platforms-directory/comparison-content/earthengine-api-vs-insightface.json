        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "InsightFace (computer vision) is InsightFace is a leading open-source toolkit for 2D and 3D face analysis, providing production-ready models for face recognition, detection, alignment, and attribute analysis. It is widely used by researchers, developers, and enterprises for building scalable face AI applications, distinguished by its extensive pre-trained model zoo, high accuracy on benchmarks, and support for both research and commercial deployment.. Users choose it for face-recognition, face-detection, face-alignment."
