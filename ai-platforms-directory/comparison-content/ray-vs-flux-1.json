        "Both Ray and Flux.1 are fundamentally open-source projects, but their licensing and commercial models differ significantly. Ray is completely open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution for both personal and commercial purposes. Organizations can deploy Ray on their own infrastructure—whether on-premises, in the cloud, or on Kubernetes—without any licensing fees. However, commercial support and managed services are available through Anyscale, the company behind Ray, for enterprises requiring professional support, training, or cloud-hosted solutions.\n\nFlux.1 employs a dual-license approach that distinguishes between research and commercial use. The 'Flux.1 dev' model is released under a non-commercial license, making it freely available for research, experimentation, and personal projects. For commercial applications, businesses must license the 'Flux.1 pro' model, which involves specific terms and potentially fees depending on the scale of use. This model allows Black Forest Labs to sustain development while keeping the technology accessible. Users can run both versions locally or through cloud platforms like Hugging Face and Replicate, with associated compute costs being the primary operational expense for either tool."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Ray's feature set centers on distributed computing abstractions and specialized ML libraries. Its universal distributed execution model uses a simple @ray.remote decorator to parallelize Python functions and classes as tasks and actors. Ray Tune provides scalable hyperparameter tuning and experiment management, while Ray Serve enables scalable model serving with microservice architecture. Ray Train supports distributed training across multiple frameworks including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and XGBoost. Ray RLlib delivers industry-grade reinforcement learning capabilities, and Ray Datasets facilitate distributed data loading and preprocessing. The platform also offers automatic resource management, cluster orchestration, and fault-tolerant computation through its Actor model.\n\nFlux.1's capabilities focus exclusively on high-quality image generation. It natively generates images at 1024x1024 resolution while supporting various aspect ratios for different use cases. Its most notable feature is exceptional semantic prompt understanding, allowing it to interpret complex descriptions and maintain scene coherence. The model's training on a massive, curated dataset results in superior aesthetic quality and improved safety measures. The dual-model approach ('dev' for research, 'pro' for commercial) provides flexibility for different user needs. Flux.1 can be deployed locally for full control or accessed via cloud platforms for easier scalability, though it lacks the broad ecosystem of supporting tools that Ray provides for complete ML workflows."
