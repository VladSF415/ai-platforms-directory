        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Figma AI (generative ai) is Figma AI is a suite of integrated, context-aware artificial intelligence features within the collaborative design platform Figma. It assists designers by automating repetitive tasks, generating design elements, and offering intelligent suggestions directly within the design workflow. It uniquely embeds AI into a real-time, multi-player collaborative environment, targeting product designers and teams to accelerate UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management.. Users choose it for UI Design, UX Design, Collaborative Design."
