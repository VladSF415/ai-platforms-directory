        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "LightGBM (ml frameworks) is LightGBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft that implements tree-based machine learning algorithms. It's designed for efficiency and speed, featuring optimized histogram-based learning, leaf-wise tree growth, and direct support for categorical features. Its unique architecture makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale datasets where training speed and memory efficiency are critical constraints.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, tree-algorithms, machine-learning."
