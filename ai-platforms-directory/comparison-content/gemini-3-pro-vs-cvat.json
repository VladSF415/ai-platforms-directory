        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "CVAT (developer tools) is CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the efficient annotation of images and videos for computer vision projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D data labeling, supports team collaboration, and is built with extensibility in mind through its API and SDK. What makes it unique is its powerful interpolation for video annotation, native support for complex tasks like point clouds and 3D cuboids, and its origin as an Intel project, ensuring robust performance and active development for industrial-scale AI data pipelines.. Users choose it for data-labeling, video-annotation, point-cloud."
