        "Sora 2 (generative ai) is Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality, realistic videos up to 20 seconds long from text prompts or images. Released in September 2026, it features synchronized dialogue, ambient sound effects, and background music generated natively alongside video. Its key differentiator is the ability to generate cinematic, physically accurate videos with native audio in multiple styles including realistic, anime, and stylized formats.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, ai-video.",
        "Google AutoML (enterprise ai platforms) is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. Users choose it for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud."
