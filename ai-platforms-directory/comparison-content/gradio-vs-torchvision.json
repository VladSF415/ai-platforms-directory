        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. It's known for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool.",
        "TorchVision (computer vision) is TorchVision is the official computer vision library for PyTorch, providing essential tools for building and deploying computer vision applications. It offers a comprehensive collection of pre-trained models, popular datasets, and image transformation utilities that are production-ready and optimized for PyTorch workflows. Its tight integration with PyTorch's core framework and consistent API design make it the standard choice for researchers and developers working on vision tasks.. Users choose it for PyTorch, computer-vision, pre-trained-models."
