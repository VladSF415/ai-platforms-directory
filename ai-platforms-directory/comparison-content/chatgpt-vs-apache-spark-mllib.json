        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Apache Spark MLlib (ml frameworks) is Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable, distributed machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, designed to handle massive datasets across clusters. It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
