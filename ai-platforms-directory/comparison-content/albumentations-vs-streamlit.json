      "paragraphs": [
        "Albumentations is a specialized library squarely in the computer vision and deep learning pipeline. Its core mission is to provide fast, diverse, and reliable image transformations (augmentations) such as rotations, flips, color adjustments, and distortions. This process is essential for artificially expanding training datasets, which helps prevent overfitting and improves a model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Its tight integration with PyTorch and TensorFlow dataloaders and its ability to handle images, masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints simultaneously make it a favorite for research and production CV projects.",
        "Streamlit is a general-purpose application framework for the data science and ML community. It abstracts away the complexities of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to allow users to create data-driven web apps purely in Python. By adding simple widget commands (like `st.slider` or `st.button`) to a script, users can instantly create interactive dashboards, model demonstrators, or data exploration tools. Its value lies in speed of prototyping and deployment, making it possible to share and collaborate on data insights without formal software engineering overhead."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Both platforms are fundamentally open-source and free to use, which has been a key driver of their widespread adoption. Albumentations is completely open-source (Apache 2.0 License) with no commercial tier or hosted service; its value is delivered entirely through the library. Streamlit also maintains a powerful, fully-featured open-source core framework. However, Streamlit operates on a freemium model through its parent company, Snowflake. It offers Streamlit Community Cloud for free public app hosting, but for private apps, enterprise features, enhanced security, and scalable deployment, organizations typically move to Snowflake's paid offerings like Snowpark or managed services. Thus, while the initial tool is free for both, scaling Streamlit applications in a professional context often involves commercial costs."
