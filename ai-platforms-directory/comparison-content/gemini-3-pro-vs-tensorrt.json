        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "TensorRT (ml frameworks) is TensorRT is NVIDIA's high-performance deep learning inference SDK and runtime, designed to optimize and deploy trained models for production. It provides layer fusion, precision calibration, and kernel auto-tuning to maximize throughput and minimize latency on NVIDIA GPUs. It uniquely delivers deterministic, hardware-aware optimizations that are critical for real-time applications in autonomous systems, recommendation engines, and large-scale AI services.. Users choose it for nvidia, gpu-inference, model-optimization."
