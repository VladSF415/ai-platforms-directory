      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models reflect the fundamental nature of each tool. Cursor v2 operates on a freemium model.

If your daily work involves navigating large codebases, implementing features from specs, or modernizing legacy systems, Cursor v2 can provide an unparalleled productivity boost. The freemium model is a fair trade for the advanced capabilities, though teams should budget for subscriptions. The primary caution is the necessity of maintaining code review practices, as the agent's output must be validated.\n\nFor **machine learning practitioners, data scientists, and researchers specializing in computer vision, Albumentations is the indispensable, non-negotiable recommendation**. No other library matches its combination of speed, reliability, and comprehensive feature set for image augmentation. It is a critical, foundational component of the modern deep learning pipeline. Its open-source nature ensures it can be integrated into any project without cost, and its performance directly translates to faster training iterations and better model accuracy. While it lacks any generative AI features, that is not its purpose; its purpose is to provide the highest quality, augmented data to *your* AI models.\n\nIn summary, if you build software applications, explore Cursor v2. If you build computer vision models, use Albumentations. They are both best-in-class tools for their respective domains, and a sophisticated tech stack in 2026 might very well include both: using Cursor v2 to write the Python code that defines a training script, which then utilizes the Albumentations library within its data loading pipeline.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Albumentations within a project I'm developing in Cursor v2?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. This is a common and powerful combination. Cursor v2 is an intelligent code editor. You can use it to write Python code for a computer vision project. Within that code, you would import and use the Albumentations library to create your data augmentation pipelines. Cursor's AI agent could even help you write the correct Albumentations code, suggest augmentation strategies, or debug issues with your pipeline, as it understands Python syntax and popular libraries. They operate at different layers: Cursor edits the source code, and Albumentations is a library that executes when that code is run."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Albumentations use AI or machine learning to perform augmentations?",
      "answer": "No, Albumentations itself does not contain or use AI/ML models. It is a deterministic image processing library. Its transformations (like rotate, flip, change brightness) are based on mathematical and procedural operations. Its primary role is to augment training data *for* AI and machine learning models. By providing more varied and robust training examples, it helps those models learn better features and generalize more effectively. It is a tool for preparing the fuel (data) that powers AI engines, not an AI engine itself. Cursor v2, in contrast, directly integrates and utilizes large language models (AI) to perform its tasks."
