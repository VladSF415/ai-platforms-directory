      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Ray follows a completely open-source model with no licensing fees, making it accessible for organizations of all sizes. Users can deploy Ray on their own infrastructure—whether on-premises, in the cloud, or on Kubernetes clusters—without direct platform costs. However, organizations must consider the operational expenses of running and maintaining their Ray clusters, including compute resources, storage, and DevOps expertise. For enterprise support and managed services, Anyscale (the company behind Ray) offers commercial offerings, but the core framework remains free and open-source.",
        "ElevenLabs operates on a freemium model with tiered subscription plans. The free tier provides limited monthly character generation with basic voice options, while paid plans (Starting, Creator, Pro, and Scale) offer increasing character limits, access to more voices, advanced voice cloning capabilities, and commercial usage rights. Pricing scales with usage volume, making it predictable for content creators but potentially expensive for high-volume applications. The platform's value proposition lies in its specialized, production-ready voice synthesis that would be extremely costly to develop in-house."
