        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. Users choose it for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool."
