        "OpenAI Gym (ml frameworks) is OpenAI Gym is a widely adopted open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a standardized collection of environments—from classic control problems and Atari games to robotics simulations—with a unified Python interface, enabling reproducible benchmarking. Its primary value lies in establishing a common experimental framework that has become the de facto standard for RL research and education.. It's known for reinforcement-learning, rl-environments, benchmarking.",
        "Figma AI (generative ai) is Figma AI is a suite of integrated, context-aware artificial intelligence features within the collaborative design platform Figma. It assists designers by automating repetitive tasks, generating design elements, and offering intelligent suggestions directly within the design workflow. It uniquely embeds AI into a real-time, multi-player collaborative environment, targeting product designers and teams to accelerate UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management.. Users choose it for UI Design, UX Design, Collaborative Design."
