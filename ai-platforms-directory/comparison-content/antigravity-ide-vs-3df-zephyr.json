        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "3DF Zephyr (computer vision) is 3DF Zephyr is a professional-grade photogrammetry software that automatically reconstructs highly detailed 3D models and scenes from standard photographs. It is designed for professionals in fields like cultural heritage, surveying, and visual effects, offering comprehensive workflows from point cloud generation to textured mesh creation and measurements. Its key differentiator is a powerful, user-friendly pipeline that balances advanced automation with extensive manual editing and export tools, all accelerated by multi-GPU support.. Users choose it for photogrammetry, 3d-reconstruction, point-cloud."
