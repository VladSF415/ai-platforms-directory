        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Detectron2 (ml frameworks) is Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's (FAIR) open-source, PyTorch-based library for state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and keypoint detection. It is designed for researchers and engineers who need a flexible, high-performance platform to train, evaluate, and deploy custom models, offering a modular design that allows for easy extension and experimentation with new architectures. Its unique value lies in its production-ready codebase, extensive model zoo with pre-trained models, and its role as a foundational research platform behind many cutting-edge publications in computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, pytorch."
