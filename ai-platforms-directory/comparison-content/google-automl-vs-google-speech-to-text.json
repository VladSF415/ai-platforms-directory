        "Google AutoML (enterprise ai platforms) is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. It's known for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud.",
        "Google Speech-to-Text (audio ai) is Google Speech-to-Text is a cloud-based AI service that converts audio to text using Google's state-of-the-art Chirp foundation model. It enables developers and businesses to add accurate speech recognition to applications, supporting real-time streaming, batch processing, and custom model adaptation. Its key differentiators are industry-leading accuracy powered by Google's deep research, support for over 125 languages and variants, and seamless integration within the Google Cloud ecosystem.. Users choose it for speech-recognition, audio-transcription, google-cloud."
