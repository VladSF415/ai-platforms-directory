        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Databricks AutoML (ml frameworks) is Databricks AutoML is an automated machine learning solution integrated within the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It accelerates the end-to-end ML lifecycle by automatically training, tuning, and deploying models while providing full transparency into the process (glass-box approach). It uniquely combines the scalability of Apache Spark with built-in MLflow tracking and Databricks Feature Store integration, making it a powerful tool for data teams building production-ready models.. Users choose it for automated-ml, model-training, mlops."
