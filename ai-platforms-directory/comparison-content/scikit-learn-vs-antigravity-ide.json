  "verdict": "The verdict between Scikit-learn and Antigravity IDE is not about which tool is objectively better, but which is the right specialized instrument for your specific task in 2026. If your core work involves data analysis, building predictive models, and working within the traditional machine learning lifecycle, Scikit-learn remains the indispensable, non-negotiable choice. Its reliability, depth of algorithms, and seamless fit within the Python ecosystem are unmatched for its purpose. Attempting to use an AI code editor like Antigravity to replace Scikit-learn's specialized mathematical and statistical functions would be impractical.\n\nConversely, if you are a software developer, web engineer, or someone who writes code to build applications, services, or scripts, Antigravity IDE represents a monumental leap forward. Its multi-agent AI system offers a glimpse into the future of programming, where AI handles boilerplate, debugging, and integration testing. For development work, especially involving web technologies where its browser automation shines, Antigravity can provide exponential productivity gains that a traditional library like Scikit-learn cannot.\n\nTherefore, the clear recommendation is to choose based on your primary role: **Data Scientists and ML Engineers should use Scikit-learn** for their modeling work, possibly within an environment that could itself be edited by Antigravity. **Software and Web Developers should strongly consider adopting Antigravity IDE** to harness the power of collaborative AI agents and automate their development workflow. In an ideal 2026 tech stack, these tools are complementary, not competitive—you might use Antigravity to write and test the code that ultimately imports and utilizes Scikit-learn to power your application's machine learning features.",
