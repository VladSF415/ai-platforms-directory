        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2026, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. It's known for api, image-generation, video-generation.",
        "Google AutoML (enterprise ai platforms) is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. Users choose it for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud."
