        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "LocalAI (generative ai) is LocalAI is a self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible API server that enables users to run large language models (LLMs), generate images, and transcribe audio locally on their own hardware. Its key capabilities include providing a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API, supporting a wide range of open-source models, and operating entirely offline for enhanced privacy and data control. It uniquely targets developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious individuals who want the power of generative AI without relying on external cloud services or incurring API costs.. Users choose it for self-hosted, openai-compatible, local-inference."
