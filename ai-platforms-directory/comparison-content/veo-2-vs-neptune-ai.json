        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Neptune (llm ops) is Neptune is an MLOps metadata store designed to log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all metadata generated during the machine learning lifecycle. It is purpose-built for teams running large-scale experiments, particularly for foundation model training, offering deep layer-level monitoring, visualization, and debugging. Its unique value lies in its highly flexible metadata structure, seamless integration with any ML framework, and powerful collaboration features that centralize experiment tracking for distributed teams.. Users choose it for experiment-tracking, model-registry, metadata-store."
