        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "vLLM (llm ops) is vLLM is an open-source library specifically designed for high-performance inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Its key capability is the implementation of the PagedAttention algorithm, which dramatically improves memory efficiency and throughput by managing the KV cache in non-contiguous, paged memory, similar to virtual memory in operating systems. This makes it uniquely suited for developers and organizations needing to deploy LLMs at scale with minimal hardware requirements and maximum speed.. Users choose it for llm-inference, model-serving, high-throughput."
