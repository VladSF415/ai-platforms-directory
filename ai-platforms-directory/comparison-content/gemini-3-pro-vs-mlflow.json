        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "MLflow (ml frameworks) is MLflow is an open-source platform that manages the complete machine learning lifecycle from experimentation to production. It provides tools for experiment tracking, reproducible runs, model packaging, and centralized model registry, enabling teams to collaborate effectively on ML projects. Its framework-agnostic design allows integration with any ML library, making it uniquely versatile across diverse ML ecosystems.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, model-registry."
