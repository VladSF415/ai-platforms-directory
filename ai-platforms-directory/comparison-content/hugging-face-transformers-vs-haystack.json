        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "Haystack (ml frameworks) is Haystack is an open-source framework by deepset for building production-ready natural language search systems and question-answering applications. It enables developers to create end-to-end NLP pipelines that can retrieve, process, and generate answers from large document collections using state-of-the-art language models. What makes it unique is its modular pipeline architecture that seamlessly integrates with various document stores (Elasticsearch, Weaviate, FAISS) and supports both sparse and dense retrieval methods alongside generative models.. Users choose it for retrieval-augmented-generation, document-search, question-answering."
