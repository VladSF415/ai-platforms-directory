        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Medis Medical Imaging (healthcare ai) is Medis Medical Imaging provides advanced, vendor-independent software for the quantitative analysis of cardiac images from CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Ultrasound. Its core capability is delivering precise, reproducible measurements of cardiac structure and function (like vessel dimensions, plaque volume, and ventricular strain) to support clinical decision-making and research. It is uniquely trusted by leading hospitals, core labs, and pharmaceutical companies for its 30+ years of scientific validation and its proprietary technologies like QFR (Quantitative Flow Ratio).. Users choose it for cardiac-imaging, medical-image-analysis, quantitative-cardiology."
