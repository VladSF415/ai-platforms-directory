        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Optuna (ml frameworks) is Optuna is an open-source, automatic hyperparameter optimization framework designed specifically for machine learning. Its key capabilities include defining search spaces with a dynamic, Pythonic API and employing efficient sampling and pruning algorithms to accelerate the tuning process. It is unique for its 'define-by-run' paradigm, which allows for dynamic construction of parameter spaces, making it highly flexible and favored by researchers and engineers for complex optimization tasks.. Users choose it for hyperparameter-optimization, automl, bayesian-optimization."
