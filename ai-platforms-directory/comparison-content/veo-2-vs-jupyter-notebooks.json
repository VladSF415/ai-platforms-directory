        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks (ml frameworks) is Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key capability is interactive, exploratory computing, enabling users to run code in multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia) in a cell-based environment and see results immediately. It is uniquely powerful for data science, scientific research, and education due to its blend of executable code, rich media output, and explanatory text in a single, shareable document.. Users choose it for open-source, interactive-computing, data-science."
