        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "DVC (Data Version Control) (ml frameworks) is DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system specifically designed for machine learning projects, enabling Git-like operations for large datasets, models, and experiments. It provides data versioning, experiment tracking, and reproducible pipeline management while maintaining seamless integration with Git for code. What makes it unique is its ability to handle large files and datasets efficiently while keeping the familiar Git workflow, making ML projects as reproducible and collaborative as software development.. Users choose it for mlops, data-versioning, experiment-tracking."
