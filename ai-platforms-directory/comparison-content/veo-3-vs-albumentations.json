        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Albumentations (computer vision) is Albumentations is a high-performance, open-source Python library for image augmentation, designed specifically for deep learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of efficient, optimized image transformations (geometric, color, and pixel-level) that are crucial for training robust neural networks. Its key differentiator is its exceptional speed and flexibility, offering a unified API that works seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other frameworks, making it a de facto standard in research and production pipelines.. Users choose it for image-augmentation, data-preprocessing, pytorch-integration."
