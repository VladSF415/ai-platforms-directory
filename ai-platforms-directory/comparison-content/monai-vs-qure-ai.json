    {
      "name": "MONAI",
      "description": "An open-source, PyTorch-based framework for developing deep learning applications in medical imaging. It provides domain-optimized tools, transforms, and pre-trained models to accelerate research and deployment for tasks like segmentation, registration, and classification.",
      "strengths": [
        "Open-source and community-driven, enabling customization and research",
        "Strong focus on reproducibility and interoperability with clinical standards like DICOM",
        "Specialized libraries for handling 3D/4D medical data challenges",
        "Flexible framework for building and experimenting with new models"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Requires technical expertise in AI/ML to develop and deploy applications",
        "Not a ready-to-use clinical product; it is a development framework",
        "Deployment and clinical validation are the responsibility of the end user or developer"
