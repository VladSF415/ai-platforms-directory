        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
        "Polars (ml frameworks) is Polars is a high-performance DataFrame library designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis on large datasets. It provides a Python (and Rust) API with a focus on speed, leveraging Rust's memory safety and multi-threading for parallel execution. Its unique lazy evaluation engine optimizes queries automatically, making it ideal for data scientists and engineers working with data that exceeds memory limits or requires rapid processing.. Users choose it for dataframes, rust, parallel-processing."
