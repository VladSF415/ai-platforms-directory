      "title": "Overview",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor v2, launched in late 2026, represents a paradigm shift in integrated development environments. It's not just another code editor with AI features bolted on—it's a completely rebuilt platform designed from first principles around multi-LLM collaboration.

Its seamless compatibility with VSCode extensions means developers can transition without losing their existing toolchain.",
        "JAX, developed by Google Research, is a Python library that has become indispensable for machine learning research and high-performance numerical computing. Unlike traditional frameworks, JAX embraces a pure functional programming paradigm while providing composable transformations like automatic differentiation (grad), just-in-time compilation (jit), vectorization (vmap), and parallelization (pmap). Its NumPy-compatible API lowers the learning curve while its XLA backend delivers exceptional performance across CPUs, GPUs, and Google's custom TPUs. JAX isn't an editor or IDE—it's the computational engine that powers everything from academic research to production-scale AI systems."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor v2 and JAX reflect their fundamentally different natures. Cursor v2 follows a freemium model typical of modern SaaS developer tools. A free tier provides core AI-assisted editing capabilities with limitations on advanced features, daily queries, or context window size. Paid tiers (likely monthly or annual subscriptions) unlock unlimited usage, priority access to the most powerful LLMs (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o), enterprise features, and enhanced support. This model aligns with its position as a productivity tool for professional developers and teams.\n\nJAX is completely open-source and free to use, distributed under the Apache License 2.0. There are no subscription fees, usage limits, or tiered features. However, the \"cost\" of using JAX comes in the form of computational resources (GPU/TPU time) and developer expertise. While the library itself is free, running large-scale JAX computations requires significant infrastructure, which can be expensive through cloud providers like Google Cloud Platform (which offers TPU access) or AWS. The primary investment is in learning its functional paradigm and optimization techniques."

    {
      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor v2's feature set revolves around enhancing developer productivity through AI integration. Its flagship capability is full codebase awareness, allowing the AI to understand relationships between files, dependencies, and project structure. The multi-LLM agentic workflow lets developers leverage different models (Claude for reasoning, GPT for generation) for different tasks. One-click refactors and migrations automate tedious code changes, while the built-in terminal and agentic debugging provide an integrated development environment where AI can suggest fixes based on error output. Semantic search goes beyond text matching to find conceptually related code.\n\nJAX's features are mathematical and computational transformations. Just-in-time compilation via XLA optimizes Python/NumPy code to run efficiently on hardware accelerators. Automatic differentiation through grad() enables gradient-based optimization essential for machine learning. The vmap() function automatically vectorizes operations for batch processing without manual loops, while pmap() parallelizes computations across multiple devices. The composable nature of these transformations (you can jit(grad(vmap(func)))) is uniquely powerful. Unlike Cursor, JAX provides no IDE features, code generation, or editing capabilities—it's purely a computational backend library."

      "title": "Use Cases",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Use Cursor v2 when your primary goal is accelerating software development workflows. It excels for developers maintaining or building large codebases who need help understanding legacy code, implementing new features, or performing systematic refactoring. It's ideal for full-stack development, web applications, mobile apps, and system software where developer time is the bottleneck. Teams adopting AI-assisted development will find Cursor v2's integrated approach more efficient than switching between an editor and separate AI tools.\n\nUse JAX when you're conducting numerical computing research or building high-performance machine learning models. It's the framework of choice for cutting-edge AI research in academia and industry, particularly for novel architectures, reinforcement learning, scientific computing, and differentiable programming. Projects requiring mathematical precision, custom gradient definitions, or scaling across multiple GPUs/TPUs benefit from JAX's paradigm. It's less suitable for general software development or as a replacement for higher-level frameworks like PyTorch for standard deep learning tasks unless you need its specific functional transformations."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Cursor v2 to write JAX code?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Cursor v2 is an excellent editor for writing JAX code. Its AI capabilities can help you understand JAX's functional patterns, debug compilation errors, and implement complex transformations. The semantic search can help navigate research codebases, and the multi-LLM integration can explain JAX concepts or suggest optimizations. However, Cursor won't execute or compile your JAX code—you'd still need a Python environment with JAX installed for that. They work well together: Cursor as the intelligent editor and JAX as the computational engine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is JAX replacing TensorFlow or PyTorch?",
      "answer": "Not exactly. JAX operates at a different level of abstraction. While TensorFlow and PyTorch are full-featured deep learning frameworks with extensive ecosystems for production deployment, JAX is more of a foundational library for composable numerical computing. Many researchers use JAX for its flexibility and performance, while higher-level libraries like Flax, Haiku, or Elegy build neural network APIs on top of JAX. In 2026, PyTorch remains dominant in industry for standard deep learning, while JAX excels in research requiring novel architectures, mathematical purity, or extreme performance scaling. They coexist with different strengths."
