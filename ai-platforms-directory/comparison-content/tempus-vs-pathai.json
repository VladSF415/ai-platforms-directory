  "verdict": "Tempus and PathAI serve complementary but distinct roles in oncology care. Tempus is best suited for oncologists seeking comprehensive molecular and clinical data integration for treatment decision support and clinical trial matching. PathAI is optimal for pathologists requiring enhanced diagnostic accuracy, quantitative biomarker analysis, and standardized scoring in anatomic pathology. The choice depends on clinical workflow needs: Tempus for therapeutic decision-making at the point of care, PathAI for diagnostic precision in pathology workflows.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which platform is better for comprehensive cancer treatment planning?",
      "answer": "Tempus is specifically designed for comprehensive cancer treatment planning by integrating genomic data with clinical information to provide evidence-based treatment options and clinical trial matching. PathAI focuses on diagnostic accuracy in pathology, which provides critical input for treatment planning but does not offer the same level of therapeutic decision support."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can PathAI be used for non-oncology applications?",
      "answer": "While PathAI's primary focus and published validation are in oncology applications including breast, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancers, the platform's underlying technology for digital pathology analysis may have applications in other tissue-based diagnostics. However, clinical validation for non-oncology uses would require specific evaluation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do these platforms require special training for clinical staff?",
      "answer": "Both platforms typically require some level of training for optimal use. Tempus may require training for oncologists and clinical staff on interpreting genomic reports and integrating AI recommendations into clinical workflows. PathAI typically requires training for pathologists on using the digital pathology interface and interpreting AI-assisted analyses. Both platforms are designed to integrate into existing clinical workflows with appropriate training support."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the regulatory pathways differ between these platforms?",
      "answer": "Tempus operates genomic assays under CLIA/CAP certification with FDA-cleared laboratory processes, with AI components functioning as clinical decision support under physician oversight. PathAI may have specific algorithms cleared as Class II medical devices through FDA 510(k) pathways while primarily operating laboratory-developed test services through CLIA-certified laboratories. Both approaches are valid regulatory pathways for clinical laboratory services."
