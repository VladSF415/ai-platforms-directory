      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models reflect the fundamentally different audiences and distribution methods. AutoGen is completely open-source (released under an MIT license), with no direct cost for using the framework itself. However, users incur costs from the underlying LLM APIs (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, etc.) and computational resources. This model is ideal for experimentation, research, and integration into custom projects without upfront software licensing fees.\n\nOsiriX employs a traditional paid software model. It offers a fully-featured, FDA-cleared version (OsiriX MD) for diagnostic use, which requires a purchase, and a free version (OsiriX Lite) with limitations for non-diagnostic use. The investment covers the sophisticated visualization engine, ongoing development for medical standards compliance, regulatory clearance costs, and dedicated support. This model ensures reliability, security, and professional support required in a clinical setting."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can AutoGen be used for medical image analysis?",
      "answer": "Not directly for image rendering or diagnostic viewing. AutoGen is a framework for orchestrating AI agents through conversation. In theory, you could create an AutoGen agent system that coordinates calls to specialized medical AI APIs (e.g., for tumor detection in images) and manages the workflow. However, it cannot replace the core visualization, measurement, and PACS management features of a dedicated DICOM viewer like OsiriX. They could be complementary in a pipeline where OsiriX handles visualization and initial processing, and AutoGen agents manage data routing, report generation, or decision support logic based on outputs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is OsiriX suitable for AI/ML developers?",
      "answer": "Yes, but specifically for those developing AI in the medical imaging domain. OsiriX provides a powerful plugin architecture (using macOS frameworks) that allows developers to integrate custom image analysis algorithms, machine learning models, and visualization tools directly into the OsiriX interface. This enables clinical deployment and testing of AI models within a familiar diagnostic workflow. However, it is not a general-purpose AI development framework like AutoGen. Its API is focused on image data structures, viewer hooks, and GUI integration, not on building conversational agents or general workflow automation."
