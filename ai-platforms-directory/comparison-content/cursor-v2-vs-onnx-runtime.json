        "ONNX Runtime is not a development environment but a high-performance cross-platform inference and training engine for machine learning models in the ONNX format. Its primary role is in the MLOps pipeline, after model development. It takes models exported from training frameworks and provides a unified API to run them with optimal speed on diverse hardware—from NVIDIA GPUs (via CUDA/TensorRT) to Intel CPUs (via OpenVINO) and Apple Silicon (via CoreML). Its unique value is abstracting away hardware complexity to deliver consistent, fast, and portable model execution for production deployment."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models reflect the tools' different target users and business cases. Cursor v2 operates on a freemium model. A free tier likely offers core AI-assisted editing features with limitations on advanced agent usage, model calls, or offline capabilities. Paid tiers (Pro, Team, or Enterprise) would unlock deeper agentic workflows, priority access to more powerful models, enhanced project context windows, and dedicated support. This model is typical for productivity SaaS tools aimed at individual developers and teams.\n\nONNX Runtime is completely open-source (MIT license), with no direct cost for usage. Its 'pricing' is the engineering investment required for integration and deployment. Commercial support and advanced enterprise features (like enhanced security and management tools) are available through Microsoft, its primary maintainer, and other cloud providers who offer managed ONNX Runtime services (e.g., Azure Machine Learning). For most teams, the core runtime is free, making it exceptionally cost-effective for scaling ML inference, though expertise is needed to leverage it fully."
