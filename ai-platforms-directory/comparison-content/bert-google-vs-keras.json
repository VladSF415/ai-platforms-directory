        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. It's known for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings.",
        "Keras (ml frameworks) is Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the complexities of lower-level frameworks, allowing developers to build, train, and deploy models with minimal code. Its key uniqueness lies in its multi-backend support, seamlessly running on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, making it a versatile and framework-agnostic tool for the deep learning community.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, model-prototyping."
