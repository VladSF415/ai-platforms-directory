        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Core ML (developer tools) is Core ML is Apple's proprietary machine learning framework designed to enable developers to integrate trained machine learning models directly into applications running on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Its key capability is performing fast, on-device inference, leveraging Apple's hardware accelerators (Neural Engine, GPU, CPU) for optimal performance while ensuring user data privacy by keeping processing local. It is unique for its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, providing a standardized format (.mlmodel) and tools that simplify the deployment of models from popular training frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.. Users choose it for apple, on-device-ai, ios-development."
