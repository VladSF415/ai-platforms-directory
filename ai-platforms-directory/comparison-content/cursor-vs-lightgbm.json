      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor and LightGBM reflect their different natures. Cursor operates on a freemium model. A free tier is available with limited AI queries, often sufficient for individual exploration or small projects. Paid professional or team plans (as of 2026) unlock higher usage limits, access to more powerful AI models (like GPT-4 and Claude 3), advanced codebase indexing, and collaboration features. This model is standard for SaaS developer tools. LightGBM, being an open-source framework, has no direct cost. It is completely free to use, modify, and distribute under its permissive license. The 'cost' associated with LightGBM is the computational resources (CPU/GPU, memory) required for training models and the expertise needed to implement it effectively. For enterprises, support might be obtained through consulting services or cloud platform integrations (like Azure ML), but the core library remains free."

      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor's features are centered on AI-assisted development: an in-editor AI chat for Q&A, an 'Agent Mode' for executing multi-file changes from natural language commands, context-aware intelligent completions, and edit commands that generate previewable diffs. It maintains VS Code extension compatibility. LightGBM's features are algorithmic and performance-oriented: a histogram-based algorithm for speed, leaf-wise tree growth for accuracy, direct categorical feature support, GPU acceleration, and distributed learning for scalability. Cursor's capabilities are about understanding and manipulating code logic; LightGBM's are about efficiently finding patterns in numerical and categorical data."

        "Use Cursor when you are actively developing software applications, web services, or scripts. It is ideal for generating boilerplate code, debugging complex issues, refactoring legacy systems, writing tests, or understanding a new codebase. It's a daily driver for developers. Use LightGBM when you are building machine learning models for tasks like fraud detection, customer churn prediction, recommendation systems, or any supervised learning problem with structured/tabular data. It is deployed in data pipelines and model training scripts, often after data has been cleaned and prepared. Crucially, you could use Cursor to write the Python script that trains a model *using* the LightGBM library, perfectly illustrating their complementary roles."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use LightGBM within the Cursor editor?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Since Cursor is a fork of VS Code with full extension support, you can use it to write Python or R code that imports and uses the LightGBM library. Cursor's AI can even help you write that code—suggesting correct LightGBM API calls, helping debug training errors, or explaining LightGBM parameters. However, Cursor does not execute the LightGBM training itself; it merely helps you write the script. The actual model training runs in your terminal or computational environment, leveraging LightGBM's installed library."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which tool is better for a beginner in programming or data science?",
      "answer": "For a programming beginner, Cursor can be a fantastic learning aid, as it can explain concepts and generate examples on-demand. However, there's a risk of becoming overly reliant on its suggestions without understanding the underlying principles. It's best used as a tutor, not a crutch. For a data science beginner, LightGBM has a steeper initial curve. It requires understanding core ML concepts (like gradient boosting, hyperparameters, cross-validation) before it can be used effectively. Beginners might start with simpler libraries (like scikit-learn) before tackling LightGBM's advanced optimizations. In both cases, foundational knowledge is crucial before leveraging these powerful tools to their full potential."
