        "Marble is Marble by World Labs is Fei-Fei Li's first commercial world model that generates editable, downloadable 3D environments from text prompts, photos, videos, 3D layouts, or panoramas. Creates persistent 3D worlds for gaming, visual effects, and virtual reality. Compatible with Vision Pro and Quest 3 VR headsets..",
        "CLIP, on the other hand, CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.."
