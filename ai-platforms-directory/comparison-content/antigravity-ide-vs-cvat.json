        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "CVAT (computer vision) is CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the efficient annotation of images and videos for computer vision projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D data labeling, supports team collaboration, and is built with extensibility in mind through its API and SDK. What makes it unique is its powerful interpolation for video annotation, native support for complex tasks like point clouds and 3D cuboids, and its origin as an Intel project, ensuring robust performance and active development for industrial-scale AI data pipelines.. Users choose it for data-labeling, video-annotation, point-cloud."
