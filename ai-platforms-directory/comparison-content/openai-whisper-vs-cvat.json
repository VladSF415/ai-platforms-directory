        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "CVAT (computer vision) is CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the efficient annotation of images and videos for computer vision projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D data labeling, supports team collaboration, and is built with extensibility in mind through its API and SDK. What makes it unique is its powerful interpolation for video annotation, native support for complex tasks like point clouds and 3D cuboids, and its origin as an Intel project, ensuring robust performance and active development for industrial-scale AI data pipelines.. Users choose it for data-labeling, video-annotation, point-cloud."
