  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can Ray be used for medical imaging AI?",
      "answer": "Yes, but indirectly. Ray itself is not a medical imaging viewer. However, it is an excellent framework for developing, training, and serving the AI models that analyze medical images. For example, you could use Ray Train to distribute the training of a tumor detection model across a GPU cluster, Ray Tune to optimize its hyperparameters, and Ray Serve to deploy it as a scalable inference service. The model's predictions could then be integrated into a clinical viewer like OsiriX via its plugin architecture. Ray handles the scalable computation, while OsiriX provides the diagnostic interface."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is OsiriX suitable for general-purpose data science or machine learning?",
      "answer": "No, OsiriX is not designed for general-purpose data science or ML. It is a specialized application exclusively for working with DICOM medical images. While its plugin architecture allows integration of AI algorithms for tasks like segmentation or classification, the core software lacks libraries for data manipulation (like Pandas), ML frameworks (like PyTorch), or distributed computing primitives. For any non-medical-image data analysis or building ML models outside the healthcare imaging domain, tools like Ray, along with standard data science libraries, are the appropriate choice."
