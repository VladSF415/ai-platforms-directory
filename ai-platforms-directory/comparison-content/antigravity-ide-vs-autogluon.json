        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "AutoGluon (workflow automation) is AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML toolkit developed by Amazon that automates the end-to-end machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment. Its key capabilities include robust automated model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensembling, with specialized support for tabular, text, and image data. It uniquely targets both practitioners and researchers by offering state-of-the-art performance 'out-of-the-box' while remaining extensible for custom modeling tasks, significantly reducing the expertise and time required to build high-quality ML models.. Users choose it for automl, amazon-aws, tabular-data."
