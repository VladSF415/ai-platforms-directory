      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Scikit-learn and Sora 2 reflect their fundamentally different development and deployment philosophies. Scikit-learn is completely open-source (BSD license), meaning there are zero licensing fees for any use—commercial, academic, or personal. Its costs are indirect: developer time for implementation, computational resources for training models, and potential infrastructure for deployment. The ecosystem is supported by community contributions and commercial entities that build services on top of it. This makes Scikit-learn exceptionally accessible and has contributed to its status as a de facto standard.\n\nSora 2 operates on a freemium model typical of OpenAI's products. While specific pricing for the 2026 release may involve tiered access, it likely follows patterns of credit-based consumption (e.g., cost per generated video second) or subscription plans with monthly generation limits. A free tier with basic capabilities or limited generations is probable to encourage adoption. The costs are operational and scale with usage. For high-volume video generation, expenses can become significant, but this is offset by the elimination of traditional video production costs like filming, editing, and sound design. The pricing is geared towards individual creators, teams, and enterprises needing scalable video content."
