      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Ollama is completely free and open-source. There are no tiers, subscriptions, or usage limits. The cost is effectively the hardware (CPU/GPU/RAM) on which you run it and the electricity to power it. This makes it highly predictable and cost-effective for individual developers, researchers, or organizations needing high-volume, private inference without cloud egress or compute fees.\n\nHugging Face Spaces operates on a freemium model. The free tier is generous, offering public Spaces with limited GPU hours (typically ~16 hours per month for the base free tier, subject to change) and community support. Paid Professional and Enterprise tiers unlock more powerful and dedicated GPU resources, longer uptime, private Spaces, increased persistent storage (beyond the free 50GB), custom domains, priority support, and advanced security features. Costs scale with compute needs and privacy requirements, making it a variable operational expense."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Hugging Face Spaces for private, commercial applications?",
      "answer": "Yes, but with caveats. The free tier only supports public Spaces. For private applications, you need at least the Hugging Face Pro tier, which allows for private Spaces. However, even with a private Space, your model inference and data processing occur on Hugging Face's cloud infrastructure. For truly confidential commercial applications where data cannot leave your premises, a local solution like Ollama or a self-hosted server is a more appropriate and secure choice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Ollama support vision models or just text-based LLMs?",
      "answer": "As of 2026, Ollama primarily focuses on text-based large language models. However, its ecosystem and support for Modelfiles allow for the integration of some multi-modal capabilities, especially as the community creates and shares configurations for vision-language models (VLMs) that are compatible with its underlying backends (like llama.cpp). Support is more experimental and model-specific compared to its robust text LLM offering. For reliably running the latest vision models in a hosted demo, Hugging Face Spaces often has more immediate and accessible support through the Model Hub."
