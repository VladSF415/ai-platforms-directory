        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Neptune (llm ops) is Neptune is an MLOps metadata store designed to log, store, display, organize, compare, and query all metadata generated during the machine learning lifecycle. It is purpose-built for teams running large-scale experiments, particularly for foundation model training, offering deep layer-level monitoring, visualization, and debugging. Its unique value lies in its highly flexible metadata structure, seamless integration with any ML framework, and powerful collaboration features that centralize experiment tracking for distributed teams.. Users choose it for experiment-tracking, model-registry, metadata-store."
