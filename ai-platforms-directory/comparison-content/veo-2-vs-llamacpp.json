        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "llama.cpp (llms) is llama.cpp is a high-performance, open-source C/C++ port of Meta's LLaMA and Llama 2 language models, designed to enable efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) directly on CPU-based hardware. Its key capabilities include advanced quantization, memory optimization, and cross-platform support, allowing models to run on commodity hardware without requiring a dedicated GPU. It uniquely targets developers and researchers seeking to deploy or experiment with LLMs in resource-constrained environments, from laptops to servers, with minimal dependencies.. Users choose it for cpu-inference, model-quantization, open-source-llm."
