        "Sora 2 (generative ai) is Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality, realistic videos up to 20 seconds long from text prompts or images. Released in September 2026, it features synchronized dialogue, ambient sound effects, and background music generated natively alongside video. Its key differentiator is the ability to generate cinematic, physically accurate videos with native audio in multiple styles including realistic, anime, and stylized formats.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, ai-video.",
        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. Users choose it for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing."
