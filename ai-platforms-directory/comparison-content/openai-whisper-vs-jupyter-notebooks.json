        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks (ml frameworks) is Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key capability is interactive, exploratory computing, enabling users to run code in multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia) in a cell-based environment and see results immediately. It is uniquely powerful for data science, scientific research, and education due to its blend of executable code, rich media output, and explanatory text in a single, shareable document.. Users choose it for open-source, interactive-computing, data-science."
