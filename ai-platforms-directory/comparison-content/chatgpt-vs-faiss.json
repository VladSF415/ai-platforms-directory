        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Faiss (ml frameworks) is Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a specialized open-source library developed by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is designed to handle massive, high-dimensional vector datasets, enabling rapid nearest neighbor searches crucial for applications like recommendation systems and semantic search. Its key differentiator is its highly optimized C++ core with GPU support, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability that outperforms naive implementations, making it a foundational tool for vector databases and AI-powered retrieval.. Users choose it for vector-search, nearest-neighbor-search, high-performance-computing."
