        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "Figma AI (generative ai) is Figma AI is a suite of integrated, context-aware artificial intelligence features within the collaborative design platform Figma. It assists designers by automating repetitive tasks, generating design elements, and offering intelligent suggestions directly within the design workflow. It uniquely embeds AI into a real-time, multi-player collaborative environment, targeting product designers and teams to accelerate UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management.. Users choose it for UI Design, UX Design, Collaborative Design."
