        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Google Document AI (nlp) is Google Document AI is a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to automatically parse, classify, and extract structured data from scanned and digital documents. It targets businesses and developers looking to automate document-intensive workflows, offering pre-trained models for common document types and the ability to build custom processors. Its key differentiator is deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem and its use of Google's foundational AI research to deliver high-accuracy extraction with minimal configuration.. Users choose it for document-processing, intelligent-document-processing, optical-character-recognition."
