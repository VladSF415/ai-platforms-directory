It enables users to scale familiar libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to larger-than-memory datasets and multi-core or distributed clusters, using dynamic task scheduling to optimize complex workflows. Its unique value lies in providing a seamless transition from single-machine to distributed computing with minimal code changes, making it a powerful tool for data scientists and engineers.. Users choose it for parallel-computing, distributed-computing, big-data."
