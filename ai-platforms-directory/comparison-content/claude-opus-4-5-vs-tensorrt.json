        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "TensorRT (ml frameworks) is TensorRT is NVIDIA's high-performance deep learning inference SDK and runtime, designed to optimize and deploy trained models for production. It provides layer fusion, precision calibration, and kernel auto-tuning to maximize throughput and minimize latency on NVIDIA GPUs. It uniquely delivers deterministic, hardware-aware optimizations that are critical for real-time applications in autonomous systems, recommendation engines, and large-scale AI services.. Users choose it for nvidia, gpu-inference, model-optimization."
