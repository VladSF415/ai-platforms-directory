        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Keras (ml frameworks) is Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the complexities of lower-level frameworks, allowing developers to build, train, and deploy models with minimal code. Its key uniqueness lies in its multi-backend support, seamlessly running on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, making it a versatile and framework-agnostic tool for the deep learning community.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, model-prototyping."
