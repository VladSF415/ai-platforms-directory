  "verdict": "The choice between Arterys and Aidoc depends entirely on clinical need. Arterys is optimal for specialists requiring quantitative measurement and analytics in cardiac, liver, lung, and breast imaging. Aidoc is better suited for radiology departments prioritizing workflow efficiency and rapid detection of critical findings across broader imaging studies. Both platforms have established FDA clearances and clinical validation, with Arterys excelling in quantitative analysis and Aidoc in workflow optimization.",
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which is better for quantitative cardiac MRI analysis?",
      "answer": "Arterys is specifically designed for quantitative cardiac MRI analysis with FDA-cleared applications for this purpose, making it the more appropriate choice for detailed cardiac measurement and analytics."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which platform is better for emergency department radiology workflow?",
      "answer": "Aidoc is typically better suited for emergency settings due to its real-time critical finding detection and prioritization capabilities, which help reduce time-to-notification for urgent conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do both platforms require special hardware?",
