        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "ONNX Runtime (ml frameworks) is ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. It accelerates model execution across diverse hardware (CPUs, GPUs, specialized accelerators) via a unified interface to vendor-specific libraries. Its unique value lies in enabling framework-agnostic, production-ready deployment with maximal hardware utilization through a flexible provider system.. Users choose it for model-inference, cross-platform, hardware-acceleration."
