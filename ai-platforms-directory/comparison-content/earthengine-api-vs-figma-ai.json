        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Figma AI (generative ai) is Figma AI is a suite of integrated, context-aware artificial intelligence features within the collaborative design platform Figma. It assists designers by automating repetitive tasks, generating design elements, and offering intelligent suggestions directly within the design workflow. It uniquely embeds AI into a real-time, multi-player collaborative environment, targeting product designers and teams to accelerate UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management.. Users choose it for UI Design, UX Design, Collaborative Design."
