        "AutoGen (agent platforms) is AutoGen is an open-source framework from Microsoft Research for building and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems. It enables developers to create, manage, and coordinate multiple conversational AI agents—each with specialized roles, capabilities, and tools—to collaboratively solve complex tasks through structured dialogue. Its unique value lies in its flexible, code-centric approach to agent definition and its seamless integration with human oversight, making it a powerful tool for automating intricate workflows that require reasoning, tool use, and iterative problem-solving.. Users choose it for multi-agent-systems, conversational-ai, workflow-automation."
