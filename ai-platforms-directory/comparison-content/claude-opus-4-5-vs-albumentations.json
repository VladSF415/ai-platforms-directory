        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Albumentations (computer vision) is Albumentations is a high-performance, open-source Python library for image augmentation, designed specifically for deep learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of efficient, optimized image transformations (geometric, color, and pixel-level) that are crucial for training robust neural networks. Its key differentiator is its exceptional speed and flexibility, offering a unified API that works seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other frameworks, making it a de facto standard in research and production pipelines.. Users choose it for image-augmentation, data-preprocessing, pytorch-integration."
