        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) (computer vision) is YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a groundbreaking real-time object detection system that applies a single convolutional neural network to the entire image, simultaneously predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in one forward pass. Its key capability is performing detection at high frame rates (e.g., 45-155 FPS depending on version) while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it uniquely efficient compared to traditional multi-stage detectors. It primarily targets developers and researchers in computer vision who need fast, deployable object detection for applications like video analysis, robotics, and autonomous systems.. Users choose it for object-detection, real-time-inference, convolutional-neural-networks."
