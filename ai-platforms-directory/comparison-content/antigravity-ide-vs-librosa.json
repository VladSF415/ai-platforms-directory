        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "librosa (audio ai) is Librosa is a core Python library for music and audio signal analysis, providing the fundamental building blocks for extracting features like tempo, pitch, and timbre from audio files. It is specifically designed for music information retrieval (MIR) and audio analysis tasks, offering robust implementations of spectral analysis, beat tracking, and chroma feature extraction. Its unique value lies in being a free, research-grade, and de facto standard tool for academics, data scientists, and developers working on audio-based machine learning, distinguishing itself from general-purpose signal processing libraries with its music-specific algorithms and ease of use.. Users choose it for audio-processing, music-information-retrieval, spectral-analysis."
