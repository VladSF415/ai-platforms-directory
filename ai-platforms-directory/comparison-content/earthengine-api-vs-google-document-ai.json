        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Google Document AI (nlp) is Google Document AI is a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to automatically parse, classify, and extract structured data from scanned and digital documents. It targets businesses and developers looking to automate document-intensive workflows, offering pre-trained models for common document types and the ability to build custom processors. Its key differentiator is deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem and its use of Google's foundational AI research to deliver high-accuracy extraction with minimal configuration.. Users choose it for document-processing, intelligent-document-processing, optical-character-recognition."
