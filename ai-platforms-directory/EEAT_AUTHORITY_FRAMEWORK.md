**Goal:** Establish as the highest-ranking authority source on hottest AI topics through maximum E-E-A-T implementation.

---

## 🎯 E-E-A-T Pillars Implementation

### **1. EXPERIENCE (Real-World Testing & Hands-On Evaluation)**

#### Testing Methodology
```
For each blog post, establish credibility through:

📋 TESTING FRAMEWORK:
- Number of tools tested: 8-12 per post
- Testing duration: Document specific hours spent
- Test environment: Specify hardware/conditions used
- Number of test cases: Minimum 15-20 per tool
- Real use cases evaluated: At least 5 scenarios

EXAMPLE:
"We tested 10 leading AI agent platforms over 120+ hours,
evaluating each across 18 distinct workflow automation scenarios
on enterprise-grade infrastructure (8-core CPU, 32GB RAM, cloud deployment)."
```

#### Real Metrics & Data
```
✓ Actual performance benchmarks (speed, accuracy %)
✓ Real pricing data (confirmed direct from vendors)
✓ User feedback (collected from actual users, not reviews)
✓ Deployment time (weeks/months to implement)
✓ Cost of ownership (total cost, not just subscription)
✓ Integration difficulty (technical complexity score 1-10)
✓ Learning curve (hours to productivity)

NEVER:
✗ Market claims ("industry reports say...")
✗ Manufacturer marketing numbers
✗ Theoretical benchmarks
✗ Generic statements ("very fast", "highly accurate")
```

#### Author Credentials & Bio

   - "We were provided demo accounts (but tested like real users)"

3. Data Freshness
   - "This post updated: [Date]"
   - "Next review scheduled: [Date]"
   - "Pricing confirmed: [Month/Year]"
   - "Based on [Version] of the tool"

4. Uncertainty Signals

- Use cases it's designed for
- Team size/expertise required
- Budget requirements

NOT IDEAL FOR
- Use cases where it struggles
- Organizational types that experienced issues
- Budget constraints it doesn't fit
- Teams lacking required expertise

NEVER:
✗ "This tool is amazing!" (emotional, not analytical)
✗ "This tool is terrible" (without evidence)
✗ Only positives (looks like promotional content)
✗ Unverified claims (check everything)
```
