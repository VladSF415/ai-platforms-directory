      "description": "Datashader is an open-source graphics pipeline system designed to create accurate, meaningful visualizations of extremely large datasets (billions of points) that are otherwise impossible to render with standard plotting libraries. It works by aggregating data into a fixed-resolution grid, applying statistical reductions, and then rendering the result as an image, effectively avoiding overplotting and memory issues. Its unique value lies in its ability to faithfully represent the true structure and density of massive data for data scientists, researchers, and analysts, enabling insight discovery without misleading artifacts.",
