      "description": "Stanford Alpaca is an instruction-following large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 7B model using a novel self-instruct methodology. It was designed to generate coherent and helpful responses to human-written instructions, mimicking the capabilities of models like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 but at a significantly lower cost for research replication. Its primary distinction was demonstrating that high-quality instruction-following behavior could be achieved with a relatively small model and a modest, algorithmically generated dataset, making it a landmark academic project for efficient LLM alignment.",
