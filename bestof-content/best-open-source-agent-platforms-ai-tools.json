      "description": "Semantic Kernel is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) from Microsoft that enables developers to seamlessly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) from services like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and others into conventional programming applications (C#, Python, Java). Its key capability is providing a flexible, plugin-based architecture to orchestrate AI services, manage prompts, access native skills, and handle memory, allowing developers to build sophisticated, AI-augmented agents and copilots. It uniquely bridges the gap between traditional application logic and generative AI by treating prompts and native code as composable 'skills' or 'plugins' within a cohesive 'kernel,' making it a powerful framework for agentic and multi-step AI workflows.",
