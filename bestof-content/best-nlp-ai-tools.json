      "description": "CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.",
