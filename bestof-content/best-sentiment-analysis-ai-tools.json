      "description": "Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.",
