      "answer": "AI video dubbing and voice cloning, as seen in tools like Rask AI and Descript's Overdub, use a combination of technologies. First, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcribes the original audio. Then, machine translation converts the text to the target language. For voice cloning, a neural network is trained on a short sample of the speaker's voice to create a unique voice model. A text-to-speech (TTS) system then synthesizes the translated script using this cloned voice, aiming to preserve tone, pitch, and emotional cadence. Finally, some advanced tools use AI to slightly adjust the speaker's lip movements in the video to better match the new language's phonetics (lip-sync). The realism in 2025 is remarkably high for supported languages, often indistinguishable from the original to casual listeners, though perfection depends on voice sample quality and language pair. It's a revolutionary tool for scalable localization."
