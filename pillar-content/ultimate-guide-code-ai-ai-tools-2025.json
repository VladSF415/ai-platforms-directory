This 'autocomplete on steroids' is the core feature of tools like GitHub Copilot and Codeium, turning partial thoughts into complete, working code almost instantly."
    },
    {
      "title": "Interactive Code Explanation and Documentation",
      "description": "When inheriting a legacy codebase or reviewing a complex pull request, developers can use the chat functionality in assistants like Cursor or Codeium. You can highlight a confusing block of code and ask, \"What does this function do?\" or \"Explain this regular expression.\" The AI will provide a clear, plain-English explanation, making code comprehension and documentation much faster, which is invaluable for onboarding and knowledge sharing within teams."
    },
    {
      "title": "Cross-Language Translation and Refactoring",
      "description": "Need to port a utility function from Python to Go, or update a class to use a new library version? AI coding assistants excel at code translation and refactoring. By providing the original code and a clear instruction (e.g., \"Convert this to TypeScript\" or \"Refactor this to use async/await\"), the AI can generate the equivalent code in the target syntax, adhering to the idioms and best practices of the new language or paradigm."
    },
    {
      "title": "Automated Debugging and Test Generation",
      "description": "AI assistants can help identify potential bugs by analyzing error messages and stack traces, suggesting probable fixes. Furthermore, they can automatically generate unit tests.

It uses advanced reasoning and long-term planning to handle tasks that would take a human developer hours. While still in early access, Devin targets software teams and enterprises looking to automate entire development cycles, acting more as an AI team member than a simple assistant. It signifies a move from AI-assisted coding to AI-driven development."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do AI coding assistants work with all programming languages?",
      "answer": "Most mainstream AI coding assistants support a wide range of popular programming languages—typically including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, C#, Go, Ruby, PHP, and more. However, their proficiency and quality of suggestions can vary significantly between languages. Models are generally best at languages with abundant public training data (Python, JavaScript). Support for newer, niche, or proprietary languages may be limited or non-existent. Always check the official documentation of the tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot's supported languages list, Codeium's language list) for specifics. For esoteric languages, an open-source model you can fine-tune yourself, like Code Llama, might be the only viable option, as you can train it on domain-specific data."
