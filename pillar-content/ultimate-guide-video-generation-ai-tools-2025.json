  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between an AI video generator and traditional video editing software?",
      "answer": "The core difference lies in the role of the user. Traditional software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro are powerful tools for *editing* raw footage that you must first source, shoot, or acquire. They require significant skill to manipulate timelines, effects, and audio. An AI video generator, like Fliki or InVideo AI, is a *creation* tool. You start with an idea, text, or script, and the AI *generates* the core visual and audio assets, assembling a draft video for you. It automates the initial heavy lifting of asset creation and basic editing. While some AI platforms include editing features, their primary function is generative, making them ideal for rapid content creation from scratch, whereas traditional software is for detailed post-production of existing material."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI-generated videos be copyrighted, and who owns the content?",
      "answer": "Copyright and ownership are critical and evolving areas. Typically, the platform's Terms of Service dictate ownership. Most commercial AI video creation tools grant the user a license to use the generated content, often for commercial purposes, provided they have a paid subscription. However, it's vital to read the fine print. Some key questions to ask: Does the platform guarantee the output is royalty-free? Do they indemnify you against copyright claims from their training data? Ownership of the *specific output* is usually yours, but the underlying AI model is not. Always verify the license for any stock media or AI voices used within the video. For high-stakes commercial work, consulting a legal professional is recommended, as laws are still catching up to this technology."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to create a video with an AI video generator?",
      "answer": "The time can vary dramatically based on the tool's complexity and the video's length. For a simple 60-second social media clip using a template-driven platform like InVideo AI or Fliki, you can go from text prompt to final render in under 10 minutes. More complex videos with custom avatars, precise animations (using SceneCraft or Animotion), or high-resolution outputs (with Runway ML or Google Veo 2) may take 30 minutes to an hour or more, including time for iterative refinements. The true time savings of AI video creation isn't just in rendering; it's in the elimination of pre-production (casting, location scouting) and the drastic reduction of manual editing labor, compressing a process that traditionally took days into a single sitting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the limitations of current AI video generation technology?",
      "answer": "While impressive, the technology has clear limitations in 2025. A major challenge is maintaining **temporal consistency**—keeping characters, objects, and backgrounds perfectly stable and coherent over longer durations or complex camera movements. Physics can sometimes appear unnatural. AI can also struggle with highly specific, nuanced prompts or generating logically perfect human hands and intricate details. Furthermore, most tools have limits on video length for a single generation, often capping outputs at 60-120 seconds. There's also a risk of generic or \"sameness\" in outputs if not sufficiently customized. Finally, the ethical considerations around deepfakes, bias in training data, and the impact on creative industries are ongoing discussions that users must be aware of."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is an AI video generator suitable for creating full-length films or documentaries?",
      "answer": "Currently, AI video generation tools are not yet robust enough to autonomously create a coherent, feature-length narrative film. However, they are becoming incredibly powerful **tools within the filmmaker's toolkit**. Professionals use them for pre-visualization (creating storyboards and animatics with Runway ML), generating specific visual effects or background plates, creating dream sequences or stylized flashbacks, and prototyping concepts. For documentaries, they could be used to recreate historical scenes where footage is unavailable. The creation of a full film still requires immense human direction, editing, sound design, and narrative control. AI is best seen as a collaborative assistant that handles specific, labor-intensive tasks, significantly speeding up parts of the production pipeline rather than replacing the filmmaker's central creative role."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I ensure my AI-generated video is unique and doesn't look generic?",
      "answer": "To avoid generic outputs, you must leverage the customization features of your chosen platform. **First, provide highly detailed and unique text prompts**—avoid clichés and be specific about style, mood, and action. **Second, always customize the default assets**: replace stock music with your own track, upload your brand's images and logos, and use custom color palettes. **Third, utilize platforms that allow fine-grained control**, like SceneCraft for scene composition or tools that let you edit the AI-generated script and visuals directly. **Finally, consider using hybrid workflows**: generate the base video with AI, then import it into traditional editing software to add personal touches, unique transitions, and custom audio mixing. Your creative input in guiding and refining the AI's work is the key to uniqueness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hardware or software is needed to use these AI video creation tools?",
      "answer": "One of the greatest advantages of modern AI video generators is their accessibility. The vast majority, including Fliki, HeyGen, InVideo AI, and Vidura, are **cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms**. This means you only need a standard modern web browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and a stable internet connection. There is no need for powerful local hardware (high-end GPU, lots of RAM) because the AI processing happens on the provider's servers. Some professional-grade tools, like certain advanced features in Runway ML, may have desktop applications or benefit from more local power for faster previews, but the core functionality remains cloud-based. This makes top-tier automated video production available to anyone with a laptop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use my own voice or a specific person's likeness with these tools?",
      "answer": "Yes, many advanced platforms offer this capability, but it comes with important distinctions and ethical considerations. **Voice Cloning** is a common feature in tools like HeyGen, Hedra, and Screenplay. You typically provide a short sample of clear audio, and the AI creates a model of that voice to synthesize new speech. **Avatar Creation/Likeness** is more complex. Some platforms allow you to train a custom AI avatar from a video of yourself (HeyGen's \"Instant Avatar\"). Using the likeness of another specific person without their explicit, informed consent raises serious ethical and legal issues related to deepfakes and personality rights. Responsible platforms have strict terms of service prohibiting misuse. Always ensure you have full rights and permission to clone a voice or likeness, and use these powerful features transparently and ethically."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is AI video generation impacting jobs in the video production industry?",
      "answer": "AI video creation is transforming the industry, much like computer graphics did decades ago. It is automating repetitive, time-consuming tasks (rotoscoping, basic editing, simple animation, voiceover recording for multiple languages), which can increase efficiency and lower costs for production houses. This is shifting the demand for skills. There will be less need for certain entry-level technical roles but a growing demand for **AI Video Directors** or **Prompt Engineers**—creative professionals who can expertly guide AI models, curate outputs, and integrate them into larger projects. The core creative roles—directors, cinematographers, storytellers, editors—are not being replaced but are being empowered with new, powerful tools. The industry impact is one of augmentation and evolution, requiring professionals to adapt and add AI literacy to their skill sets to remain competitive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I look for in terms of support and resources when choosing a tool?",
      "answer": "Robust support and learning resources are crucial for maximizing your investment. Look for a platform that offers: **1. Comprehensive Knowledge Base/Help Center:** Detailed articles and tutorials on all features. **2. Responsive Customer Support:** Multiple channels like email, live chat, or ticketing systems, with clear service level agreements for paid plans. **3. An Active User Community:** Forums, Discord servers, or Facebook groups where users share tips, templates, and creative solutions. **4. Regular Webinars & Tutorials:** Evidence that the company is actively educating its users on new features and best practices. **5.
