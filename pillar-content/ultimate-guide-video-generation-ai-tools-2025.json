    {
      "question": "What is the difference between an AI video generator and traditional video editing software?",
      "answer": "Traditional video editing software (like Adobe Premiere Pro or DaVinci Resolve) is a powerful toolset for manually assembling, cutting, and enhancing footage that you must first film or source elsewhere. It requires significant skill and time. An AI video generator, conversely, is a creation engine. You provide a textual idea or script, and the AI automatically generates the core video content—sourcing or creating visuals, syncing voiceovers, and assembling scenes. While some AI tools include editing features, their primary value is in automating the initial creation from scratch, drastically reducing the time and expertise barrier. Many professionals now use both: AI for rapid prototyping and content generation, and traditional software for final polish and complex sequencing."
    },
    {

      "answer": "Yes, many advanced platforms now offer voice and avatar cloning features specifically for this purpose. Tools like HeyGen, Hedra, and Screenplay allow you to upload a short sample of your audio to create a personalized AI voice model. For likeness, you can typically train a custom AI avatar by uploading a video of yourself speaking. This enables the creation of videos where your digital avatar delivers scripts in your cloned voice, perfect for scaling personalized communication. It's crucial to review each platform's terms of service regarding data usage for cloning and to ensure you retain the rights to your biometric data."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are videos created with AI tools copyright-free for commercial use?",
      "answer": "This is a critical consideration. Generally, you own the final video output you create using these platforms, but the underlying rights depend on the tool's assets. Most platforms grant you a commercial license for videos created on their platform. However, you must verify the licensing of any stock media, music, or AI voice models used within the video. Some platforms use fully royalty-free libraries, while others may have restrictions. Always read the Terms of Service and Licensing agreements of your chosen AI video creation tool to ensure your commercial use is fully compliant and that you can legally use the generated content for marketing, sales, or broadcasting."

    {
      "question": "What are the current limitations of text-to-video AI technology?",
      "answer": "While rapidly advancing, AI video generation has notable limitations in 2025. First, achieving complex, multi-shot narratives with perfect continuity and logical scene transitions remains challenging; outputs are often best as short clips. Second, AI can struggle with precise physics, detailed human hand movements, and generating consistent characters from different angles over time. Third, while voiceovers are improving, conveying nuanced human emotion and tone can sometimes fall short. Finally, the technology requires very clear, descriptive prompts; vague inputs lead to generic or incoherent results. These limitations are shrinking but mean AI is currently a powerful co-creator or tool for specific applications rather than a complete replacement for all human-directed filmmaking."
