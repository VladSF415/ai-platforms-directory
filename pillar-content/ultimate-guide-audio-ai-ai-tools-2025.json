  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between an AI voice generator and text-to-speech (TTS)?",
      "answer": "The terms are often used interchangeably, but there is a nuanced distinction. Traditional Text-to-Speech (TTS) refers to the broader technology that converts written text into synthesized spoken audio, which historically could sound robotic. **AI Voice Generator** is a modern subset of TTS that specifically uses advanced deep learning models—like neural networks and generative AI—to produce voices that are remarkably lifelike, expressive, and human-like. These AI models are trained on thousands of hours of human speech, learning nuances of intonation, rhythm, and emotion. Therefore, while all modern AI voice generators are TTS systems, not all TTS systems are the sophisticated AI voice generators we discuss today. Platforms like Murf AI represent this new wave of AI-powered, high-quality voice synthesis."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is AI speech recognition in 2025, and what affects accuracy?",

However, accuracy can be significantly impacted by several real-world factors: **Audio Quality** (background noise, poor microphone input, overlapping speech), **Speaker Characteristics** (strong accents, speech impediments, speaking speed), and **Content Complexity** (technical jargon, rare proper nouns, domain-specific vocabulary). To maximize accuracy, use high-quality audio recordings, consider tools that offer custom language model training (to adapt to your specific terminology), and leverage features like speaker diarization to separate voices. For critical applications, a human-in-the-loop review for final polish is still a best practice."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is voice cloning ethical, and what are its legitimate use cases?",
      "answer": "Voice cloning technology raises significant ethical and legal considerations. Its ethical use is contingent on **informed consent, transparency, and non-malicious intent**. Legitimate use cases include: **Accessibility** (creating a synthetic voice for individuals who have lost their ability to speak), **Content Creation** (with explicit permission, cloning a brand ambassador's voice for multilingual marketing), **Media & Entertainment** (ethically dubbing an actor's voice in post-production or for video games), and **Personal Use** (creating a voice avatar for audiobooks or personal assistants). It is crucial to use platforms with robust consent verification and to never clone a voice for deception, fraud, or to create content without the speaker's permission. Always adhere to platform terms of service and relevant laws regarding voice as a biometric identifier."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI audio tools work in real-time for live captioning or translation?",
