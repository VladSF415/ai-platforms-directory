  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between AI productivity tools and traditional automation software?",
      "answer": "Traditional automation software follows fixed, rule-based workflows programmed by humans (e.g., 'if this, then that'). It executes predefined tasks without adaptation. AI productivity tools, in contrast, utilize machine learning to understand context, learn from data, and make intelligent decisions. For example, a traditional tool might auto-format a slide to a template, while an AI tool like Beautiful.AI intelligently rearranges content and chooses visuals based on the slide's semantic meaning. AI tools are dynamic, adaptive, and capable of handling unstructured tasks like writing, design, and personalized tutoring, which rigid automation cannot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are AI productivity tools going to replace human jobs?",
