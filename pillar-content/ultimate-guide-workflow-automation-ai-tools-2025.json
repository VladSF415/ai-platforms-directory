  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between traditional workflow automation and AI workflow automation?",
      "answer": "Traditional workflow automation, often called Robotic Process Automation (RPA), follows strict, pre-programmed rules (\"if this, then that\"). It excels at repetitive, structured tasks like copying data between fields. AI workflow automation introduces cognitive capabilities. It can understand unstructured data (emails, documents, speech), make predictions, learn from outcomes, and handle ambiguity. For example, a traditional automation might move an invoice from an email to a folder if it contains the word \"invoice.\" An AI-powered workflow would read the invoice, extract vendor, amount, and due date using NLP, validate it against a purchase order, predict the approval likelihood, and route it to the correct approver—handing exceptions like missing information intelligently. AI process optimization creates adaptive, intelligent systems rather than rigid scripts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who are the primary users of AI workflow automation tools?",
