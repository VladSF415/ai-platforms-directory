  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What is the main difference between traditional BI and AI-powered Business Intelligence?",
      "answer": "Traditional Business Intelligence is primarily descriptive and retrospective. It uses dashboards and reports to answer \"What happened?\" based on historical data, relying heavily on human analysts to manually query, interpret, and hypothesize. AI-powered BI, or augmented analytics, automates this process and adds predictive and prescriptive layers. It uses machine learning to automatically find patterns, forecast future outcomes (\"What will happen?\"), and suggest optimal actions (\"What should we do?\"). It can also process unstructured data like text and video, understand natural language queries, and generate narrative summaries of insights, dramatically increasing the speed, depth, and accessibility of business intelligence."
