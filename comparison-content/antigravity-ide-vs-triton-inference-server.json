        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Triton Inference Server (ml frameworks) is NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is an open-source, high-performance inference serving software designed to deploy, run, and scale AI models from any framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT) on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure. It uniquely enables production AI workloads by providing features like dynamic batching, concurrent model execution, and model ensembles to maximize throughput and utilization. Its primary audience is ML engineers and DevOps teams building scalable, multi-framework inference pipelines in data centers, cloud, or edge environments.. Users choose it for NVIDIA, Model Serving, Inference Optimization."
