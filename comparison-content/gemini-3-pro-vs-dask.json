        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Dask (ml frameworks) is Dask is a flexible, open-source library for parallel and distributed computing in Python. It enables users to scale familiar libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to larger-than-memory datasets and multi-core or distributed clusters, using dynamic task scheduling to optimize complex workflows. Its unique value lies in providing a seamless transition from single-machine to distributed computing with minimal code changes, making it a powerful tool for data scientists and engineers.. Users choose it for parallel-computing, distributed-computing, big-data."
