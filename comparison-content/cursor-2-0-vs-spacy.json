      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models reflect the tools' different target users and business philosophies. Cursor 2.0 operates on a freemium model, offering a free tier with basic AI-assisted editing capabilities while reserving advanced features like the full-project AI agent, autonomous refactoring, and priority model access for paid subscriptions. This model caters to professional developers and teams willing to pay for productivity gains. In contrast, spaCy is completely open-source (MIT license) with no tiered pricing. All features, including pre-trained models, training APIs, and transformer integrations, are freely available. However, for spaCy, costs may arise from computational resources needed to run models, potential commercial support contracts, or custom model development. For budget-conscious projects or academic research, spaCy's zero-cost entry is advantageous, while Cursor's freemium model aligns with commercial software development where ROI on developer time is measurable."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use spaCy within Cursor 2.0?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. Cursor 2.0 is a code editor, so you can write Python code that imports and uses the spaCy library just as you would in any other IDE or editor. Cursor's AI might even assist you in writing that code, suggesting correct spaCy API calls or helping debug your NLP pipelines. However, Cursor's AI does not possess spaCy's specialized NLP capabilities internally; it would be helping you write code that calls the separate spaCy library you've installed in your project environment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cursor 2.0 suitable for data science or NLP model development?",
      "answer": "Cursor 2.0 can be an excellent editor for writing the code that builds, trains, or evaluates NLP models (including those using spaCy), thanks to its general AI-assisted coding features. However, it does not replace specialized NLP libraries. You would use Cursor to write your Python scripts, but you would still rely on spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, or TensorFlow to provide the actual NLP algorithms and model architectures. Cursor's strength here is in accelerating the surrounding software development, not in providing the core NLP functionality itself."
