        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Ray (ml frameworks) is Ray is an open-source, unified compute framework that enables developers to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a large cluster with minimal code changes. Its core provides low-level distributed computing primitives (tasks, actors, objects) and high-level libraries for machine learning (Ray Train, Tune, Serve, RLlib), making it uniquely suited for building end-to-end, distributed AI applications. It is primarily targeted at ML engineers, researchers, and data scientists who need to parallelize workloads, manage complex compute clusters, and productionize AI models efficiently.. Users choose it for distributed-computing, parallel-processing, ml-ops."
