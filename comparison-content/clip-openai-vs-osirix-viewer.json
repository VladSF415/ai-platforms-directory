        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "OsiriX DICOM Viewer (healthcare ai) is OsiriX is a comprehensive DICOM viewer and image processing software specifically designed for medical imaging. It provides advanced 2D, 3D, and 4D (time series) visualization, post-processing, and analysis tools for radiological images from modalities like CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT. Primarily targeted at radiologists, clinicians, and researchers, its uniqueness lies in being one of the first FDA-cleared, Mac-native DICOM workstations with extensive plugin support and a powerful, user-friendly interface for complex volumetric rendering.. Users choose it for DICOM-Viewer, Medical-Imaging, Radiology-Workstation."
