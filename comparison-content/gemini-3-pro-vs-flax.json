        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Flax (ml frameworks) is Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX, designed for flexible and expressive machine learning research and production. It provides a functional, immutable approach to model definition and training, leveraging JAX's automatic differentiation and XLA compilation for speed. Its key differentiator is a clean, research-friendly API that balances flexibility for experimentation with the ability to scale to large models and datasets, making it a popular choice within the JAX ecosystem.. Users choose it for JAX, Neural-Networks, Functional-Programming."
