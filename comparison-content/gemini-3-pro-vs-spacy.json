        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "spaCy (nlp) is spaCy is an open-source, industrial-strength library for advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It provides efficient, production-ready pipelines for tasks like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, named entity recognition, text classification, and more. It is designed for developers, data scientists, and researchers who need to build real-world applications with a focus on speed, accuracy, and ease of integration, distinguishing itself with its streamlined API, comprehensive pre-trained models, and robust linguistic annotations.. Users choose it for natural-language-processing, python-library, text-analysis."
