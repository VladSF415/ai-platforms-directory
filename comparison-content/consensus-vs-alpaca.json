        "Consensus is Consensus is an AI-powered search engine designed specifically for scientific research. It uses large language models (LLMs) to read, extract, and synthesize findings directly from peer-reviewed academic papers, allowing users to ask research questions in plain English and get evidence-based answers with citations. It uniquely focuses on providing consensus-level insights by analyzing multiple studies, making it a powerful tool for students, researchers, and professionals who need to quickly understand the scientific landscape on a topic.. It's known for academic-search, research-synthesis, evidence-based.",
        "Stanford Alpaca, on the other hand, is Stanford Alpaca is an instruction-following large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 7B model using a novel self-instruct methodology. It was designed to generate coherent and helpful responses to human-written instructions, mimicking the capabilities of models like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 but at a significantly lower cost for research replication. Its primary distinction was demonstrating that high-quality instruction-following behavior could be achieved with a relatively small model and a modest, algorithmically generated dataset, making it a landmark academic project for efficient LLM alignment.. Users choose it for instruction-tuning, self-instruct, llama."
