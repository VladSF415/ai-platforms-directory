        "Code Llama is Code Llama is a family of large language models (LLMs) specifically fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 2 for programming and code-related tasks. It excels at generating, explaining, debugging, and completing code across a wide range of popular languages like Python, C++, Java, and JavaScript. It is uniquely positioned as a state-of-the-art, open-source alternative to proprietary code models, offering specialized variants for infilling and long-context support.. It's known for llm, code-generation, programming-assistant.",
        "Goose by Block, on the other hand, is Goose is Block's open-source AI coding agent that runs entirely on your local machine, prioritizing privacy and control. Unlike cloud-based coding assistants, Goose processes all code locally using models like Claude, GPT-4, or self-hosted LLMs. It can read your codebase, execute commands, make changes, and learn from your feedback - all while keeping your code private. Its key differentiator is complete data sovereignty and the ability to work offline.. Users choose it for open-source, local-ai, privacy."
