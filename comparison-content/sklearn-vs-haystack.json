        "Scikit-learn (ml frameworks) is Scikit-learn is a foundational, open-source Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, offering a consistent API for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Its primary strength lies in its accessibility for beginners, robustness for production, and its role as the de facto standard for implementing classical, non-deep-learning ML workflows in the Python data science ecosystem.. It's known for Python, Classical ML, Data Science.",
        "Haystack (ml frameworks) is Haystack is an open-source framework by deepset for building production-ready natural language search systems and question-answering applications. It enables developers to create end-to-end NLP pipelines that can retrieve, process, and generate answers from large document collections using state-of-the-art language models. What makes it unique is its modular pipeline architecture that seamlessly integrates with various document stores (Elasticsearch, Weaviate, FAISS) and supports both sparse and dense retrieval methods alongside generative models.. Users choose it for retrieval-augmented-generation, document-search, question-answering."
