      "title": "Overview",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor is a specialized, purpose-built AI code editor forked from VS Code. Its core identity is as an integrated development environment where AI is not just an add-on but the central feature. It functions as a true pair programmer, allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI agents that have deep awareness of the project's structure and code. Its unique value lies in actions like 'Agent Mode,' where it can plan and execute multi-file changes from a high-level instruction, and its seamless edit-and-diff workflow directly within the editor.",
        "Claude is a foundational large language model from Anthropic, designed as a general-purpose AI assistant. Its uniqueness stems from its Constitutional AI training, which aims to make it helpful, harmless, and honest. Claude excels at processing vast amounts of information (up to 200K tokens), analyzing uploaded documents (PDFs, images, code), and generating high-quality text and code. It is accessed primarily through a web chat interface and a powerful API, making it a flexible engine for both direct use and integration into other applications."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Both platforms operate on a freemium model, but their pricing structures target different usage patterns. Cursor offers a free tier with limited usage of its advanced AI features (like GPT-4 and Claude 3), which is often sufficient for light individual use. Its paid 'Pro' plan, typically a monthly subscription, provides significantly higher quotas for AI queries, enables the powerful Agent Mode for complex tasks, and offers faster response times. This model is straightforward for individual developers or small teams.\n\nClaude also provides a generous free tier via its web interface (claude.ai), with usage limits on its most capable models like Claude 3 Opus. Its paid 'Claude Pro' subscription unlocks higher usage limits, priority access, and early feature access. For developers and businesses, Anthropic offers a separate, usage-based API pricing model where you pay per token (input and output). This can be more cost-effective for high-volume, automated integrations but requires more careful cost management. For direct coding assistance, Cursor's subscription may be simpler, while Claude's API offers greater scalability for building custom tools."

      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor's features are laser-focused on the coding workflow within an IDE: AI Chat in Editor for code-specific Q&A, Agent Mode for autonomous multi-file task execution, Intelligent Completions that understand project context, and Edit & Diff Generation for safe, previewable code changes. Its strength is its deep integration—it indexes your codebase to provide semantically aware assistance and retains full VS Code extension compatibility.\n\nClaude's features emphasize broad capability and safety: Constitutional AI training reduces harmful outputs, a massive 200K token context window allows it to process entire codebases or long documents in a single prompt, and multimodal file upload lets it analyze various formats. It is an advanced code generator and debugger, but its interaction is primarily through chat. Its most powerful feature is API access, allowing developers to build Claude's reasoning into their own applications, websites, or workflows, which Cursor does not offer natively."

      "title": "Use Cases",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Use Cursor when your primary need is to write, refactor, and understand code within a dedicated editor. It is ideal for software developers and engineers who want an AI deeply embedded in their daily coding ritual—perfect for tasks like adding a new feature across several files, understanding a legacy codebase through chat, or getting context-aware autocompletions. It's the tool for when you want to stay in your 'flow' within the IDE.\n\nUse Claude when you need a versatile AI assistant for a broader range of tasks that include, but are not limited to, coding. It excels at analyzing long technical documents or research papers, generating complex business reports, brainstorming creative content, and performing deep reasoning on problems. For coding, use Claude when you need to analyze a code snippet in isolation, debug an error from a log, or generate a script without the overhead of an entire project context. It is also the clear choice if you plan to integrate AI capabilities into your own product via an API."
