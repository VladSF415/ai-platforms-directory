        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Ultralytics YOLO (computer vision) is Ultralytics YOLO is an open-source computer vision framework that provides state-of-the-art YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, primarily YOLOv8 and YOLOv11, for real-time object detection, instance segmentation, image classification, and pose estimation. It is designed for developers, researchers, and production teams seeking a streamlined, Python-first workflow with extensive model export options and a simple CLI. Its unique value lies in its exceptional balance of high performance, ease of use, and comprehensive documentation, making advanced computer vision accessible without deep expertise.. Users choose it for object-detection, real-time-inference, instance-segmentation."
