        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "InsightFace (computer vision) is InsightFace is a leading open-source toolkit for 2D and 3D face analysis, providing production-ready models for face recognition, detection, alignment, and attribute analysis. It is widely used by researchers, developers, and enterprises for building scalable face AI applications, distinguished by its extensive pre-trained model zoo, high accuracy on benchmarks, and support for both research and commercial deployment.. Users choose it for face-recognition, face-detection, face-alignment."
