        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. It's known for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings.",
        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2025, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. Users choose it for api, image-generation, video-generation."
