        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "FiftyOne (computer vision) is FiftyOne is an open-source tool designed to help machine learning teams visualize, analyze, and curate their datasets, particularly for computer vision and multimodal AI. It provides powerful capabilities for exploring datasets, evaluating model performance, identifying failure modes, and searching for similar or anomalous data points. Its unique value lies in its interactive, queryable interface that bridges the gap between raw data and model insights, significantly speeding up the dataset curation and model debugging workflow.. Users choose it for dataset-visualization, model-evaluation, data-curation."
