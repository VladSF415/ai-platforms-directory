        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "tidymodels (ml frameworks) is tidymodels is a comprehensive collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning that adheres to tidyverse design principles. It provides a unified, consistent, and expressive framework for the entire modeling workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment. Its unique value lies in its opinionated, user-friendly interface that reduces cognitive load for R users familiar with the tidyverse, promoting reproducibility and modern software engineering practices in statistical learning.. Users choose it for R, tidyverse, machine-learning."
