      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor v2 and Keras reflect their distinct natures as a commercial product and an open-source project, respectively. Cursor v2 operates on a freemium model. A free tier provides access to core AI-assisted editing features, which is a significant draw for individual developers and students. However, advanced capabilities—such as access to the most powerful LLMs (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4), extended context windows for entire codebases, and priority agentic workflows—are gated behind a paid subscription. This model aligns with SaaS tools, where ongoing development and API costs are supported by user fees.\n\nKeras, in contrast, is completely open-source and free to use. Developed as a public API, it incurs no licensing costs. The 'cost' associated with Keras is primarily the computational resources required to train models (e.g., cloud GPU/TPU instances) and the developer's time. Its integration with backend frameworks means users might incur costs related to those ecosystems (like TensorFlow Extended for MLOps), but the Keras API itself is free. This makes it exceptionally accessible for academia, hobbyists, and startups, fostering widespread adoption and community-driven innovation."
