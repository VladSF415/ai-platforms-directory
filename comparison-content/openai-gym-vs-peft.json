        "OpenAI Gym (ml frameworks) is OpenAI Gym is a widely adopted open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a standardized collection of environments—from classic control problems and Atari games to robotics simulations—with a unified Python interface, enabling reproducible benchmarking. Its primary value lies in establishing a common experimental framework that has become the de facto standard for RL research and education.. It's known for reinforcement-learning, rl-environments, benchmarking.",
        "PEFT (ml frameworks) is PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a Hugging Face library that enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, drastically reducing computational and memory costs. It provides state-of-the-art methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and Adapters, making it uniquely suited for researchers and practitioners who need to customize models for specific tasks without full retraining. Its seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the go-to tool for parameter-efficient transfer learning.. Users choose it for parameter-efficient-fine-tuning, lora, adapters."
