        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "3DF Zephyr (computer vision) is 3DF Zephyr is a professional-grade photogrammetry software that automatically reconstructs highly detailed 3D models and scenes from standard photographs. It is designed for professionals in fields like cultural heritage, surveying, and visual effects, offering comprehensive workflows from point cloud generation to textured mesh creation and measurements. Its key differentiator is a powerful, user-friendly pipeline that balances advanced automation with extensive manual editing and export tools, all accelerated by multi-GPU support.. Users choose it for photogrammetry, 3d-reconstruction, point-cloud."
