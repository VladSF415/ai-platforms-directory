        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "TensorRT (ml frameworks) is TensorRT is NVIDIA's high-performance deep learning inference SDK and runtime, designed to optimize and deploy trained models for production. It provides layer fusion, precision calibration, and kernel auto-tuning to maximize throughput and minimize latency on NVIDIA GPUs. It uniquely delivers deterministic, hardware-aware optimizations that are critical for real-time applications in autonomous systems, recommendation engines, and large-scale AI services.. Users choose it for nvidia, gpu-inference, model-optimization."
