        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Cohere Command (llms) is Cohere Command is a suite of enterprise-grade large language models (LLMs) accessible via API, designed for building production-ready AI applications. It specializes in high-quality text generation, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with a strong focus on data privacy, security, and developer experience. Its unique value lies in offering powerful, fast, and steerable models that are optimized for business use cases, often positioned as a robust alternative to other leading LLM providers.. Users choose it for large-language-models, text-generation, semantic-search."
