        "Sora 2 (generative ai) is Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality, realistic videos up to 20 seconds long from text prompts or images. Released in September 2026, it features synchronized dialogue, ambient sound effects, and background music generated natively alongside video. Its key differentiator is the ability to generate cinematic, physically accurate videos with native audio in multiple styles including realistic, anime, and stylized formats.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, ai-video.",
        "OpenAI Gym (ml frameworks) is OpenAI Gym is a widely adopted open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a standardized collection of environments—from classic control problems and Atari games to robotics simulations—with a unified Python interface, enabling reproducible benchmarking. Its primary value lies in establishing a common experimental framework that has become the de facto standard for RL research and education.. Users choose it for reinforcement-learning, rl-environments, benchmarking."
