        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Google Workspace Studio (productivity) is Google Workspace Studio is an AI agent builder that lets anyone create custom automation agents for Gmail, Drive, Sheets, and other Workspace apps using plain English—no coding required. Launched in December 2025 and powered by Gemini 3, it enables business users to build AI agents that handle tasks like email triage, document summarization, approval workflows, and data processing. Its unique value is democratizing AI automation with a no-code interface and deep Workspace integration.. Users choose it for ai-agents, automation, no-code."
