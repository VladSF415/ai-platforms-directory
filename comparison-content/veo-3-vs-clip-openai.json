        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. Users choose it for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning."
