        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Keras (ml frameworks) is Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the complexities of lower-level frameworks, allowing developers to build, train, and deploy models with minimal code. Its key uniqueness lies in its multi-backend support, seamlessly running on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, making it a versatile and framework-agnostic tool for the deep learning community.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, model-prototyping."
