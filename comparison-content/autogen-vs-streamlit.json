      "title": "Overview",
      "paragraphs": [
        "AutoGen, developed by Microsoft Research, is a framework squarely focused on the emerging field of multi-agent AI systems. Its primary function is to enable developers to create, manage, and coordinate multiple 'conversable agents'—each with specialized roles, capabilities, and access to tools like code execution, APIs, and search. These agents collaborate through structured dialogue to automate intricate workflows that require reasoning, planning, and iterative problem-solving, such as automated code generation, data analysis pipelines, or research tasks. It is a code-centric, backend-focused tool for building intelligent automation systems.",
        "Streamlit, on the other hand, is a frontend-focused framework that solves the problem of sharing data insights and machine learning models. It allows data scientists to turn Python scripts into fully functional, interactive web applications in minutes. With a simple declarative API, users can add widgets, plots, and data tables, creating dashboards, model demonstrators, and internal tools without any web development expertise. Its magic lies in hot-reloading for instant feedback and seamless integration with the entire Python data stack, making it the go-to for rapid prototyping and deployment of data applications."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Both AutoGen and Streamlit are fundamentally open-source projects, meaning their core frameworks are free to use, modify, and distribute. The primary cost for both is associated with the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) API calls (e.g., from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure) that power AutoGen's agents. For Streamlit, the main cost consideration is deployment and hosting. Streamlit offers a freemium 'Community Cloud' for publicly sharing apps for free, but for private apps, team features, and higher resource limits, paid tiers (Team and Enterprise) are required. Alternatively, Streamlit apps can be self-hosted on any cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure), incurring infrastructure costs. AutoGen, being a backend framework, is typically integrated into larger applications and deployed on infrastructure the developer controls, so its runtime cost is purely the compute and LLM API expenses. There are no licensing fees for the framework itself from Microsoft."

      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "AutoGen's feature set is built for agent orchestration: customizable conversable agents with swappable LLM backends; built-in agent patterns like Assistant and UserProxy; seamless code execution and human-in-the-loop intervention; a GroupChat manager for multi-agent discussions; and extensive tool-calling capabilities for functions, APIs, and external resources. Its power is in defining complex interaction protocols and workflows. Streamlit's features are designed for UI creation: an intuitive declarative API for widgets (sliders, buttons, text inputs); native support for Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, and other visualization libraries; a powerful caching decorator for performance; Session State for managing user interactions; and a component system for custom HTML/JS. Its strength is turning data logic into an interactive interface with minimal code."

      "title": "Use Cases",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Use AutoGen when you need to automate complex, multi-step cognitive tasks. Ideal use cases include: building an automated research assistant that searches the web, summarizes papers, and writes reports; creating a multi-agent coding team where one writes code, another reviews it, and a third debugs; or orchestrating a customer service pipeline with specialized agents for intent classification, information retrieval, and response generation. Use Streamlit when you need to build an interactive application to visualize data, demo a machine learning model, or create an internal tool for non-technical stakeholders. Perfect for: building a dashboard to monitor business KPIs; creating an interactive prototype to test a new ML model with adjustable parameters; or sharing a data exploration tool with a team that allows filtering and plotting of datasets."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can AutoGen and Streamlit be used together?",
      "answer": "Yes, they can be powerful when combined. A common architecture uses AutoGen on the backend as an intelligent engine to perform complex data analysis, generate reports, or run simulations. A Streamlit frontend can then provide a user-friendly interface to configure the AutoGen task (e.g., set parameters via widgets), trigger the agent workflow, and beautifully visualize the results (tables, charts, text) that AutoGen produces. Streamlit acts as the human-in-the-loop control panel and display for the multi-agent system."
