        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "TorchVision (computer vision) is TorchVision is the official computer vision library for PyTorch, providing essential tools for building and deploying computer vision applications. It offers a comprehensive collection of pre-trained models, popular datasets, and image transformation utilities that are production-ready and optimized for PyTorch workflows. Its tight integration with PyTorch's core framework and consistent API design make it the standard choice for researchers and developers working on vision tasks.. Users choose it for PyTorch, computer-vision, pre-trained-models."
