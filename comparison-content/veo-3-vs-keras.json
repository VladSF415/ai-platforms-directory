        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Keras (ml frameworks) is Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the complexities of lower-level frameworks, allowing developers to build, train, and deploy models with minimal code. Its key uniqueness lies in its multi-backend support, seamlessly running on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, making it a versatile and framework-agnostic tool for the deep learning community.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, model-prototyping."
