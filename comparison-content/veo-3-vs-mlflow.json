        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "MLflow (ml frameworks) is MLflow is an open-source platform that manages the complete machine learning lifecycle from experimentation to production. It provides tools for experiment tracking, reproducible runs, model packaging, and centralized model registry, enabling teams to collaborate effectively on ML projects. Its framework-agnostic design allows integration with any ML library, making it uniquely versatile across diverse ML ecosystems.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, model-registry."
