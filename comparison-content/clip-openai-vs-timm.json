        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
