        "Sora 2 (generative ai) is Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality, realistic videos up to 20 seconds long from text prompts or images. Released in September 2025, it features synchronized dialogue, ambient sound effects, and background music generated natively alongside video. Its key differentiator is the ability to generate cinematic, physically accurate videos with native audio in multiple styles including realistic, anime, and stylized formats.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, ai-video.",
        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. Users choose it for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind."
