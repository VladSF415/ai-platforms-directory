        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks (ml frameworks) is Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key capability is interactive, exploratory computing, enabling users to run code in multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia) in a cell-based environment and see results immediately. It is uniquely powerful for data science, scientific research, and education due to its blend of executable code, rich media output, and explanatory text in a single, shareable document.. Users choose it for open-source, interactive-computing, data-science."
