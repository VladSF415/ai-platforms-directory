        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Weights & Biases (ml frameworks) is Weights & Biases (W&B) is an MLOps platform that helps developers and teams track, visualize, and manage the machine learning lifecycle. Its core capabilities include experiment tracking, dataset and model versioning, hyperparameter optimization, and collaborative dashboards for model evaluation. It is unique for its highly intuitive, developer-first interface, deep integration with popular ML frameworks, and powerful tools for reproducibility and collaboration that scale from individual researchers to large enterprise teams.. Users choose it for experiment-tracking, model-registry, hyperparameter-optimization."
