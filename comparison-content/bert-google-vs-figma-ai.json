        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. It's known for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings.",
        "Figma AI (generative ai) is Figma AI is a suite of integrated, context-aware artificial intelligence features within the collaborative design platform Figma. It assists designers by automating repetitive tasks, generating design elements, and offering intelligent suggestions directly within the design workflow. It uniquely embeds AI into a real-time, multi-player collaborative environment, targeting product designers and teams to accelerate UI/UX design, prototyping, and design system management.. Users choose it for UI Design, UX Design, Collaborative Design."
