      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models of Fast.ai and Midjourney highlight their divergent philosophies. Fast.ai is completely open-source and free to use. There are no licensing fees, subscription tiers, or usage limits. Costs are incurred only from the computational resources (e.g., cloud GPUs or local hardware) required to train and run models. This aligns with its mission of democratizing AI education and development.\n\nMidjourney operates on a paid subscription model. It offers several tiers (Basic, Standard, Pro, and Mega) with monthly or annual billing. Plans differ in the number of fast GPU hours per month, the ability to run jobs concurrently, and access to features like stealth mode. All paid plans grant commercial usage rights to generated images. There is no free tier for unlimited generation, though a limited trial may be available. Users pay for access to the proprietary model and its computational backend."
