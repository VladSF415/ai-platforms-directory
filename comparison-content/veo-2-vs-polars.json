        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Polars (ml frameworks) is Polars is a high-performance DataFrame library designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis on large datasets. It provides a Python (and Rust) API with a focus on speed, leveraging Rust's memory safety and multi-threading for parallel execution. Its unique lazy evaluation engine optimizes queries automatically, making it ideal for data scientists and engineers working with data that exceeds memory limits or requires rapid processing.. Users choose it for dataframes, rust, parallel-processing."
