        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Medis Medical Imaging (healthcare ai) is Medis Medical Imaging provides advanced, vendor-independent software for the quantitative analysis of cardiac images from CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Ultrasound. Its core capability is delivering precise, reproducible measurements of cardiac structure and function (like vessel dimensions, plaque volume, and ventricular strain) to support clinical decision-making and research. It is uniquely trusted by leading hospitals, core labs, and pharmaceutical companies for its 30+ years of scientific validation and its proprietary technologies like QFR (Quantitative Flow Ratio).. Users choose it for cardiac-imaging, medical-image-analysis, quantitative-cardiology."
