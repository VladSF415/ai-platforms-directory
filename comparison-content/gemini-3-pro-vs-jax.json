        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "JAX (ml frameworks) is JAX is a high-performance Python library for numerical computing and machine learning research that provides composable function transformations. It combines NumPy's familiar API with automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation via XLA, and automatic vectorization/parallelization capabilities. What makes it unique is its functional programming paradigm and ability to efficiently scale computations across GPUs and TPUs while maintaining mathematical purity.. Users choose it for Google, XLA, automatic-differentiation."
