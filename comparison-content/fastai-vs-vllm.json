        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "vLLM (llm ops) is vLLM is an open-source library specifically designed for high-performance inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Its key capability is the implementation of the PagedAttention algorithm, which dramatically improves memory efficiency and throughput by managing the KV cache in non-contiguous, paged memory, similar to virtual memory in operating systems. This makes it uniquely suited for developers and organizations needing to deploy LLMs at scale with minimal hardware requirements and maximum speed.. Users choose it for llm-inference, model-serving, high-throughput."
