        "Haystack 2.0 is Haystack 2.0 is an open-source, end-to-end framework designed for building production-ready semantic search, question answering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with large language models (LLMs). It provides developers and ML engineers with modular components for document processing, retrieval, ranking, and generation, all orchestrated within customizable pipelines. Its unique value lies in its developer-first design, extensive pre-built integrations with enterprise tools and vector databases, and built-in observability features for monitoring complex LLM applications.. It's known for rag-framework, semantic-search, llm-pipelines.",
        "Milvus, on the other hand, is Milvus is an open-source vector database designed to store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning models. Its key capability is enabling high-performance, low-latency similarity search and analytics on unstructured data at a petabyte scale, making it a foundational component for AI-powered applications. It uniquely features a cloud-native, distributed architecture that separates storage and compute, allowing for flexible scaling and high availability, primarily targeting developers and enterprises building large-scale semantic search, recommendation systems, and AI services.. Users choose it for vector-database, similarity-search, embedding-storage."
