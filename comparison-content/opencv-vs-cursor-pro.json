      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models are fundamentally different, reflecting the nature of each product. OpenCV is completely open-source and free to use under the Apache 2 License. There is no cost for the library itself, whether for personal, academic, or commercial use. This zero-cost barrier to entry is a key reason for its widespread adoption. Some commercial support and optimized modules are offered by the OpenCV.org team, but the core library remains free. Cursor Pro, as a proprietary software application, operates on a subscription-based model. While specific 2025 pricing is undefined, it typically follows a freemium or tiered subscription structure (e.g., Free, Pro, Team). Costs are associated with access to advanced AI models (Claude 4, GPT-5), increased usage limits, and collaborative features. The investment is in developer productivity, not in licensing a core technology."

        "OpenCV's features are domain-specific to computer vision: a vast repository of 2500+ algorithms for image filtering, feature detection, object recognition (with pre-trained models like YOLO), camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and optical flow. Its Deep Neural Network (DNN) module can load models from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Caffe. It includes high-performance I/O for images/video and basic GUI tools. Its capabilities are measured in frames-per-second processing and algorithmic accuracy.\n\nCursor Pro's features are centered on AI-assisted software development: advanced code completion and generation via chat, intelligent refactoring across files, automated debugging and error explanation, and the autonomous 'agent mode' for executing complex multi-step tasks (e.g., 'add a logging module to this project'). Its capabilities are measured in reduced development time, code quality improvement, and the ability to understand and navigate large, unfamiliar codebases—potentially including complex OpenCV projects."

If you must choose only one based on your immediate need, select OpenCV if you need computer vision functionality. Select Cursor Pro if you need a superior AI-assisted environment for general software development.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can Cursor Pro write OpenCV code for me?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. This is one of Cursor Pro's primary strengths. You can use its chat interface to ask it to \"write a Python script using OpenCV to capture webcam video and apply a Canny edge detector,\" and it will generate the correct code, often with explanations. It can also help debug common OpenCV errors, explain complex functions, and refactor existing vision pipelines. However, it generates code that calls the OpenCV library; it does not contain the OpenCV algorithms themselves."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is OpenCV still relevant with advanced AI models in 2025?",
      "answer": "More relevant than ever. While models like GPT-5 and Claude 4 excel at language and reasoning, OpenCV provides the essential, optimized low-level and mid-level operations that make practical computer vision possible. Many AI vision models themselves rely on OpenCV for image pre-processing, data augmentation, and result visualization. OpenCV's DNN module is also crucial for efficiently running these trained neural networks (from TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) in production. Rather than being replaced, OpenCV has evolved to integrate and support the modern AI ecosystem, solidifying its role as a foundational tool."
