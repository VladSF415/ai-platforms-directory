        "OpenAI Gym (ml frameworks) is OpenAI Gym is a widely adopted open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a standardized collection of environments—from classic control problems and Atari games to robotics simulations—with a unified Python interface, enabling reproducible benchmarking. Its primary value lies in establishing a common experimental framework that has become the de facto standard for RL research and education.. It's known for reinforcement-learning, rl-environments, benchmarking.",
        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2026, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. Users choose it for api, image-generation, video-generation."
