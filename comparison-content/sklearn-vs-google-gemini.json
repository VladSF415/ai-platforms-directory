        "Scikit-learn (ml frameworks) is Scikit-learn is a foundational, open-source Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, offering a consistent API for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Its primary strength lies in its accessibility for beginners, robustness for production, and its role as the de facto standard for implementing classical, non-deep-learning ML workflows in the Python data science ecosystem.. It's known for Python, Classical ML, Data Science.",
        "Google Gemini (llms) is Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models (LLMs) designed to process and reason across text, code, images, audio, and video. It is engineered for advanced reasoning, planning, and complex instruction-following, making it a direct competitor to models like GPT-4. Its unique integration with the Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Android) and its native multimodality from the ground up are key differentiators.. Users choose it for multimodal-ai, large-language-model, google-ai."
