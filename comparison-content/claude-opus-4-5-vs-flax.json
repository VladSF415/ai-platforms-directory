        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Flax (ml frameworks) is Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX, designed for flexible and expressive machine learning research and production. It provides a functional, immutable approach to model definition and training, leveraging JAX's automatic differentiation and XLA compilation for speed. Its key differentiator is a clean, research-friendly API that balances flexibility for experimentation with the ability to scale to large models and datasets, making it a popular choice within the JAX ecosystem.. Users choose it for JAX, Neural-Networks, Functional-Programming."
