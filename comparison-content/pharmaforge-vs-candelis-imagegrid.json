      "title": "Regulatory Compliance",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The platforms operate under fundamentally different regulatory frameworks reflecting their distinct clinical applications. PharmaForge, as a drug discovery platform, navigates FDA regulations primarily through the lens of software as a medical device (SaMD) and computational modeling guidelines. While not directly regulated as a therapeutic itself, predictions generated by the platform may influence regulatory submissions for investigational new drugs (INDs) and new drug applications (NDAs). The platform must maintain rigorous documentation of algorithm validation, training data provenance, and prediction reliability to support regulatory filings. HIPAA compliance is relevant when handling patient-derived data in target identification or biomarker discovery. Candelis ImageGrid operates under more established medical device regulations as a Class II PACS system, requiring 510(k) clearance for diagnostic image management. The platform must comply with DICOM standards, FDA guidelines for medical image management systems, and specific performance standards for diagnostic displays. HIPAA compliance is central to its operation, requiring robust security controls for protected health information (PHI) in medical images, audit trails for image access, and secure transmission protocols. Both platforms require rigorous quality management systems, but Candelis ImageGrid's regulatory pathway is more standardized given its established product category."
