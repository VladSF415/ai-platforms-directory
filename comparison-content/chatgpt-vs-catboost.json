        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "CatBoost (ml frameworks) is CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, specifically engineered for high performance on datasets with categorical features. Its key capabilities include advanced handling of categorical data without extensive preprocessing, symmetric tree structures for faster inference, and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting. It uniquely targets data scientists and machine learning engineers who need robust, out-of-the-box performance on heterogeneous data, particularly in tabular prediction tasks where categorical variables are prevalent.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, categorical-data, tabular-data."
