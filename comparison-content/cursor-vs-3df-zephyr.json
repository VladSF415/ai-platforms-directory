        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
        "3DF Zephyr (computer vision) is 3DF Zephyr is a professional-grade photogrammetry software that automatically reconstructs highly detailed 3D models and scenes from standard photographs. It is designed for professionals in fields like cultural heritage, surveying, and visual effects, offering comprehensive workflows from point cloud generation to textured mesh creation and measurements. Its key differentiator is a powerful, user-friendly pipeline that balances advanced automation with extensive manual editing and export tools, all accelerated by multi-GPU support.. Users choose it for photogrammetry, 3d-reconstruction, point-cloud."
