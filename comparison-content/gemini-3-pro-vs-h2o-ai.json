        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "H2O.ai (ml frameworks) is H2O.ai is an open-source, distributed machine learning and AI platform designed to make advanced analytics accessible. Its core product, H2O-3, provides scalable in-memory machine learning for Python, R, and Java, featuring a robust AutoML module for automatic model training and tuning. It uniquely targets both data scientists, by offering a familiar coding environment with high-performance algorithms (GLM, GBM, XGBoost, Deep Learning), and enterprise deployments, through its commercial H2O AI Cloud platform that operationalizes models and applications.. Users choose it for AutoML, Distributed-Computing, In-Memory-Analytics."
