        "CatBoost (ml frameworks) is CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, specifically engineered for high performance on datasets with categorical features. Its key capabilities include advanced handling of categorical data without extensive preprocessing, symmetric tree structures for faster inference, and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting. It uniquely targets data scientists and machine learning engineers who need robust, out-of-the-box performance on heterogeneous data, particularly in tabular prediction tasks where categorical variables are prevalent.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, categorical-data, tabular-data."
