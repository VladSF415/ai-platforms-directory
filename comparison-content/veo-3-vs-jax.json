        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "JAX (ml frameworks) is JAX is a high-performance Python library for numerical computing and machine learning research that provides composable function transformations. It combines NumPy's familiar API with automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation via XLA, and automatic vectorization/parallelization capabilities. What makes it unique is its functional programming paradigm and ability to efficiently scale computations across GPUs and TPUs while maintaining mathematical purity.. Users choose it for Google, XLA, automatic-differentiation."
