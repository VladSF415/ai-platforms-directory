        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "vLLM (llm ops) is vLLM is an open-source library specifically designed for high-performance inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Its key capability is the implementation of the PagedAttention algorithm, which dramatically improves memory efficiency and throughput by managing the KV cache in non-contiguous, paged memory, similar to virtual memory in operating systems. This makes it uniquely suited for developers and organizations needing to deploy LLMs at scale with minimal hardware requirements and maximum speed.. Users choose it for llm-inference, model-serving, high-throughput."
