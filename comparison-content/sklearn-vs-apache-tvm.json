Its key capability is automatic optimization through machine learning-based auto-tuning, enabling high-performance inference across edge devices, cloud servers, and custom hardware. What makes it unique is its hardware-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that allows a single model to be deployed efficiently across dozens of different hardware targets.. Users choose it for deep-learning-compiler, model-optimization, hardware-agnostic."
