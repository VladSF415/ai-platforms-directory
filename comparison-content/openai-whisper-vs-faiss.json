        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Faiss (ml frameworks) is Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a specialized open-source library developed by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is designed to handle massive, high-dimensional vector datasets, enabling rapid nearest neighbor searches crucial for applications like recommendation systems and semantic search. Its key differentiator is its highly optimized C++ core with GPU support, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability that outperforms naive implementations, making it a foundational tool for vector databases and AI-powered retrieval.. Users choose it for vector-search, nearest-neighbor-search, high-performance-computing."
