        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Prefect (workflow automation) is Prefect is a modern workflow orchestration platform designed to build, run, and monitor data pipelines. Its key capabilities include dynamic, DAG-free workflows, first-class observability, and resilient execution with sophisticated retry logic. It uniquely targets data engineers and scientists by offering a Python-native, developer-centric experience that treats workflows as code, making it distinct from rigid, static schedulers like Apache Airflow.. Users choose it for data-pipelines, orchestration, python."
