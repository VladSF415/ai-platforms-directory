        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks (ml frameworks) is Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key capability is interactive, exploratory computing, enabling users to run code in multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia) in a cell-based environment and see results immediately. It is uniquely powerful for data science, scientific research, and education due to its blend of executable code, rich media output, and explanatory text in a single, shareable document.. Users choose it for open-source, interactive-computing, data-science."
