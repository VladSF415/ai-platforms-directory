        "Make is Make (formerly Integromat) is a visual workflow automation platform that simplifies business process automation. In April 2025, Make introduced AI Agents for plain-language instruction-based automation. The platform emphasizes user-friendly experience and reliability for non-technical users.. It's known for workflow-automation, ai-agents, integration.",
        "Apache Beam ML, on the other hand, is Apache Beam ML is a component of the Apache Beam framework that provides a unified programming model for building portable, scalable data processing pipelines, with specialized APIs for machine learning inference. Its key capability is the RunInference API, which allows users to integrate trained models from multiple frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn) into both batch and streaming data workflows. It uniquely enables the same ML inference logic to run identically across diverse execution engines (e.g., Apache Flink, Google Cloud Dataflow, Apache Spark) and is targeted at data engineers and ML engineers building production ML systems.. Users choose it for apache-beam, machine-learning-inference, data-pipelines."
