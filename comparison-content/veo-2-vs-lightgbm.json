        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "LightGBM (ml frameworks) is LightGBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft that implements tree-based machine learning algorithms. It's designed for efficiency and speed, featuring optimized histogram-based learning, leaf-wise tree growth, and direct support for categorical features. Its unique architecture makes it particularly well-suited for large-scale datasets where training speed and memory efficiency are critical constraints.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, tree-algorithms, machine-learning."
