        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Google Gemini (llms) is Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models (LLMs) designed to process and reason across text, code, images, audio, and video. It is engineered for advanced reasoning, planning, and complex instruction-following, making it a direct competitor to models like GPT-4. Its unique integration with the Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Android) and its native multimodality from the ground up are key differentiators.. Users choose it for multimodal-ai, large-language-model, google-ai."
