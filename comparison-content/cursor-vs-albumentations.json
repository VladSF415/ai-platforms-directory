    {
      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor's feature set is centered on AI-assisted coding: an in-editor AI chat for Q&A, an 'Agent Mode' that executes multi-file changes from natural language commands, context-aware intelligent completions, and a powerful edit/diff generation tool ('Cmd/Ctrl+K'). It indexes the entire codebase for semantic understanding and retains near-full VS Code extension compatibility. Albumentations' capabilities are domain-specific: a vast collection of deterministic augmentation techniques (blur, rotation, color jitter, etc.), optimized CPU performance via OpenCV/NumPy, and native support for co-augmenting images with masks, bounding boxes, and keypoints—a critical feature for object detection and segmentation tasks. Its simple, composable API allows for easy creation of complex pipelines. While Cursor is a broad, interactive development environment, Albumentations is a focused, high-performance library for a single, data-centric task."
