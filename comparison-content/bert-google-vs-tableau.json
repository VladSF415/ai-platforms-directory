        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. It's known for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings.",
        "Tableau (analytics bi) is Tableau is a leading data visualization and business intelligence platform that enables users to connect, visualize, and share data insights through interactive dashboards and reports. Its key capabilities include drag-and-drop analytics, real-time data blending, and advanced calculations, targeting data analysts, business users, and enterprises. What makes Tableau unique is its powerful visual analytics engine, intuitive interface that requires minimal coding, and deep integration with the Salesforce ecosystem for customer-centric insights.. Users choose it for business-intelligence, data-visualization, dashboarding."
