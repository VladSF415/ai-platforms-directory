It is designed to handle massive, high-dimensional vector datasets, enabling rapid nearest neighbor searches crucial for applications like recommendation systems and semantic search. Its key differentiator is its highly optimized C++ core with GPU support, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability that outperforms naive implementations, making it a foundational tool for vector databases and AI-powered retrieval.. Users choose it for vector-search, nearest-neighbor-search, high-performance-computing."
