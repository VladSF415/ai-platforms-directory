        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "PyTorch (ml frameworks) is PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed primarily by Meta AI that provides a flexible, Pythonic platform for building and training neural networks. Its key capability is dynamic computation graphs (eager execution), which allows for intuitive debugging and rapid prototyping, while TorchScript enables seamless conversion to static graphs for optimized production deployment. It uniquely bridges the gap between research experimentation and high-performance production, making it a favorite in academic and industrial AI labs.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, machine-learning."
