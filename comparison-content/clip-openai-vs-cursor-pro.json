      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for CLIP and Cursor Pro are fundamentally different, reflecting their distinct natures. CLIP is an open-source model released by OpenAI. The core model weights and code are freely available for research, development, and commercial use, though running the model incurs computational costs (e.g., cloud GPU/TPU instances). There is no direct licensing fee for the model itself. In contrast, Cursor Pro is a commercial software product. While specific 2026 pricing details are undefined in the provided data, it typically operates on a subscription-based model (e.g., monthly or annual fee per user) for access to the advanced IDE features and its integrated AI models (Claude 4, GPT-5), which likely involve API costs passed through or bundled. Cursor Pro's cost is associated with software licensing and AI service access, not raw model weights."

      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "CLIP's features are centered on multimodal understanding: Zero-shot image classification across arbitrary categories defined by text, generation of joint embeddings for images and text in a shared latent space, enabling text-to-image search, and serving as a pre-trained vision backbone. It comes in multiple model architectures (ViT, ResNet) and was trained on 400 million image-text pairs. Cursor Pro's features are entirely focused on the software development lifecycle: AI-powered code generation and completion, intelligent refactoring suggestions, advanced debugging assistance, deep integration with specific LLMs (Claude 4, GPT-5), and a new autonomous agent mode that can plan and execute complex coding tasks. It is an end-user application, not a model API."
