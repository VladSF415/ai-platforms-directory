      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Fast.ai is entirely open-source and free. There are no tiers, usage limits, or paid APIs. All costs are associated with the underlying compute infrastructure (e.g., your own GPU or cloud instances) used to run the Fast.ai code. This makes it highly cost-predictable for training and experimentation.\n\nHugging Face operates on a freemium model. Core platform features like accessing the Model/Dataset Hub, using the Transformers library, and hosting basic demo apps on Spaces (with CPU and limited GPU) are free. Paid services include the scalable Inference API (pay-as-you-go based on compute time and memory), Inference Endpoints (dedicated, production-grade model deployment), and enhanced features for enterprise teams (SSO, audit logs, private hubs). Pricing scales with model size, latency requirements, and request volume, which can become a significant operational cost for high-traffic production applications."
