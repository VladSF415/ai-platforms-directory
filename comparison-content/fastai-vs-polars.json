        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Polars (ml frameworks) is Polars is a high-performance DataFrame library designed for efficient data manipulation and analysis on large datasets. It provides a Python (and Rust) API with a focus on speed, leveraging Rust's memory safety and multi-threading for parallel execution. Its unique lazy evaluation engine optimizes queries automatically, making it ideal for data scientists and engineers working with data that exceeds memory limits or requires rapid processing.. Users choose it for dataframes, rust, parallel-processing."
