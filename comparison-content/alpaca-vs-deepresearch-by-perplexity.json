        "Stanford Alpaca is Stanford Alpaca is an instruction-following large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 7B model using a novel self-instruct methodology. It was designed to generate coherent and helpful responses to human-written instructions, mimicking the capabilities of models like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 but at a significantly lower cost for research replication. Its primary distinction was demonstrating that high-quality instruction-following behavior could be achieved with a relatively small model and a modest, algorithmically generated dataset, making it a landmark academic project for efficient LLM alignment.. It's known for instruction-tuning, self-instruct, llama.",
        "DeepResearch (by Perplexity), on the other hand, is DeepResearch is Perplexity's advanced AI research assistant that autonomously conducts multi-step, web-enabled investigations on complex topics. It proactively decomposes queries, searches dozens of sources in real-time, and synthesizes findings into comprehensive, structured reports with inline citations and source evaluation. It uniquely automates the entire research workflow—from query planning to final synthesis—targeting professionals, academics, and analysts who need fast, well-sourced, and nuanced answers.. Users choose it for perplexity, research-assistant, web-search."
