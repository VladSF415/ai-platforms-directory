      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor v2, launched in late 2026, is not merely an update but a complete rebuild of the popular AI-powered editor. It categorizes itself as a 'code-ai' platform, deeply embedding state-of-the-art LLMs into the very fabric of the editing experience. Its primary goal is to augment and accelerate traditional software development workflows—building applications, libraries, and systems—by providing an AI agent that understands project context, performs semantic search across the codebase, and executes complex coding tasks through chat or one-click commands. It maintains high compatibility with the VSCode ecosystem, making it familiar yet supercharged.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks is a foundational open-source project in the 'ml-frameworks' and scientific computing ecosystem. It is a web-based interactive computing environment that organizes work into executable cells. This structure is uniquely suited for tasks that are exploratory, iterative, or explanatory, such as data cleaning, statistical analysis, machine learning model training, and visualization. Its document-centric approach, combining code, rich output, and Markdown, makes it an unparalleled tool for creating literate, reproducible analyses, tutorials, and research papers. It is a platform for *doing* and *explaining* computation."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models reflect the core philosophies of each platform. Cursor v2 operates on a **freemium model**. A free tier is available, offering robust AI-assisted editing capabilities, but advanced features like access to the most powerful LLMs (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4), extended context windows for whole-codebase analysis, and priority agentic workflows are gated behind a paid subscription. This model funds the intensive computational resources required for its integrated AI models.\n\nJupyter Notebooks is **completely open-source and free** to use. There are no licensing fees for the core software. Costs are incurred only at the infrastructure level—running the notebooks on your own hardware, in the cloud (e.g., Google Colab, Amazon SageMaker, Azure Notebooks), or via managed services. Many cloud providers offer free tiers with limited resources for Jupyter. The open-source nature fosters a vast ecosystem of free extensions, kernels, and community support, though enterprise-grade support and managed hosting from third-party vendors come at a cost."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Cursor v2 for data science and machine learning work?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use Cursor v2 for data science, as it supports Python and all relevant libraries. Its AI can help write data processing scripts, model training code, and fix bugs. However, it lacks the native, cell-based interactive execution and immediate inline visualization that is core to the Jupyter experience. For iterative data exploration and creating reports with mixed code and output, Jupyter Notebooks is significantly more efficient. Cursor is better for the 'engineering' side of ML, like building ML pipelines or production-serving code."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Jupyter Notebooks being made obsolete by AI coding assistants like Cursor?",
      "answer": "No, Jupyter Notebooks is not becoming obsolete. While AI assistants enhance coding within any editor, Jupyter's fundamental value proposition is different. It provides an interactive, document-centric workflow for exploration, visualization, and communication that AI code generation does not replace. In fact, AI is being integrated *into* Jupyter (e.g., via extensions like Jupyter AI). The tools serve different primary purposes: Cursor v2 optimizes for code *construction* within a project, while Jupyter optimizes for code *execution* and *explanation* within a narrative. Both are evolving and incorporating AI in ways that strengthen their core use cases."
