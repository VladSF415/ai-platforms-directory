        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Streamlit (ml frameworks) is Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to transform data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes, without requiring front-end web development skills. Its key capability is turning Python scripts into interactive apps with widgets, visualizations, and data caching through a simple declarative API. What makes it unique is its rapid development cycle with hot-reloading, a growing ecosystem of community-built components, and seamless integration with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.. Users choose it for python-framework, data-apps, prototyping."
