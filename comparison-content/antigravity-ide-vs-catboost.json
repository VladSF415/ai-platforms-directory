        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "CatBoost (analytics bi) is CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, specifically engineered for high performance on datasets with categorical features. Its key capabilities include advanced handling of categorical data without extensive preprocessing, symmetric tree structures for faster inference, and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting. It uniquely targets data scientists and machine learning engineers who need robust, out-of-the-box performance on heterogeneous data, particularly in tabular prediction tasks where categorical variables are prevalent.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, categorical-data, tabular-data."
