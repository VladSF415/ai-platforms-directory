        "OpenAI Gym (ml frameworks) is OpenAI Gym is a widely adopted open-source toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. It provides a standardized collection of environments—from classic control problems and Atari games to robotics simulations—with a unified Python interface, enabling reproducible benchmarking. Its primary value lies in establishing a common experimental framework that has become the de facto standard for RL research and education.. It's known for reinforcement-learning, rl-environments, benchmarking.",
        "Triton Inference Server (ml frameworks) is NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is an open-source, high-performance inference serving software designed to deploy, run, and scale AI models from any framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT) on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure. It uniquely enables production AI workloads by providing features like dynamic batching, concurrent model execution, and model ensembles to maximize throughput and utilization. Its primary audience is ML engineers and DevOps teams building scalable, multi-framework inference pipelines in data centers, cloud, or edge environments.. Users choose it for NVIDIA, Model Serving, Inference Optimization."
