        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Labellerr Video (computer vision) is Labellerr Video is a specialized computer vision data annotation platform designed to accelerate the creation of high-quality training datasets for video and image models. It leverages AI-powered auto-labeling, active learning workflows, and robust quality control tools to reduce manual annotation time by up to 90%. The platform uniquely targets enterprise teams and AI developers who need scalable, secure, and collaborative annotation pipelines with integrated project management.. Users choose it for video-annotation, auto-labeling, data-labeling-platform."
