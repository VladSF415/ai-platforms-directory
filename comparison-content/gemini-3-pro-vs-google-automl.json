        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Google AutoML (enterprise ai platforms) is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. Users choose it for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud."
