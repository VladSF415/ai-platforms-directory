        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2026, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. Users choose it for api, image-generation, video-generation."
