        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Faiss (ml frameworks) is Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a specialized open-source library developed by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is designed to handle massive, high-dimensional vector datasets, enabling rapid nearest neighbor searches crucial for applications like recommendation systems and semantic search. Its key differentiator is its highly optimized C++ core with GPU support, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability that outperforms naive implementations, making it a foundational tool for vector databases and AI-powered retrieval.. Users choose it for vector-search, nearest-neighbor-search, high-performance-computing."
