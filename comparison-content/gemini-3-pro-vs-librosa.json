        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "librosa (audio ai) is Librosa is a core Python library for music and audio signal analysis, providing the fundamental building blocks for extracting features like tempo, pitch, and timbre from audio files. It is specifically designed for music information retrieval (MIR) and audio analysis tasks, offering robust implementations of spectral analysis, beat tracking, and chroma feature extraction. Its unique value lies in being a free, research-grade, and de facto standard tool for academics, data scientists, and developers working on audio-based machine learning, distinguishing itself from general-purpose signal processing libraries with its music-specific algorithms and ease of use.. Users choose it for audio-processing, music-information-retrieval, spectral-analysis."
