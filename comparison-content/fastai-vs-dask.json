        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Dask (ml frameworks) is Dask is a flexible, open-source library for parallel and distributed computing in Python. It enables users to scale familiar libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn to larger-than-memory datasets and multi-core or distributed clusters, using dynamic task scheduling to optimize complex workflows. Its unique value lies in providing a seamless transition from single-machine to distributed computing with minimal code changes, making it a powerful tool for data scientists and engineers.. Users choose it for parallel-computing, distributed-computing, big-data."
