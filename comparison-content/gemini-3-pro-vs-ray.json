        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Ray (ml frameworks) is Ray is an open-source, unified compute framework that enables developers to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a large cluster with minimal code changes. Its core provides low-level distributed computing primitives (tasks, actors, objects) and high-level libraries for machine learning (Ray Train, Tune, Serve, RLlib), making it uniquely suited for building end-to-end, distributed AI applications. It is primarily targeted at ML engineers, researchers, and data scientists who need to parallelize workloads, manage complex compute clusters, and productionize AI models efficiently.. Users choose it for distributed-computing, parallel-processing, ml-ops."
