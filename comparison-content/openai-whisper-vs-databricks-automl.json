        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Databricks AutoML (ml frameworks) is Databricks AutoML is an automated machine learning solution integrated within the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It accelerates the end-to-end ML lifecycle by automatically training, tuning, and deploying models while providing full transparency into the process (glass-box approach). It uniquely combines the scalability of Apache Spark with built-in MLflow tracking and Databricks Feature Store integration, making it a powerful tool for data teams building production-ready models.. Users choose it for automated-ml, model-training, mlops."
