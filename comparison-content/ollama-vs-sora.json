      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Ollama and Sora are fundamentally different, reflecting their open-source versus proprietary natures. Ollama is completely free and open-source. There are no licensing fees, subscription costs, or usage-based charges. The primary 'cost' associated with Ollama is the computational hardware required to run models locally (a powerful CPU or GPU) and the electricity consumption. Users have full cost control and predictability. Sora, as a product from OpenAI, does not have a publicly announced pricing structure as of early 2026. It is expected to follow a credit-based or token-based pricing model similar to DALL-E and ChatGPT, where users pay per video generation or per second of video created. Costs will likely scale with video resolution, duration, and complexity. This introduces variable, ongoing expenses compared to Ollama's one-time hardware investment."

        "Ollama's feature set revolves around model orchestration and local inference. Key features include a curated model library accessible via simple pull commands (`ollama run llama3.2`), a full REST API for chat, generation, and embeddings, and Modelfiles for creating customized model configurations. It supports both CPU and GPU inference, offers full offline functionality, and includes tools for model management (list, copy, delete). Its capabilities are enabling, not generative—it provides the environment to run generative text models. Sora's features are purely generative and creative. Its flagship capability is generating high-quality videos from text prompts, with additional features like generating videos from a single static image, extending existing videos, maintaining remarkable temporal and character consistency, and simulating realistic physics. Its output is the final creative product (a video file), whereas Ollama's output is a text response or an API endpoint for integration into other applications."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Ollama to generate videos like Sora?",
      "answer": "No, Ollama cannot generate videos. Ollama is a platform for running Large Language Models (LLMs), which are text-based AI models. It generates text, code, or answers questions. To create AI videos, you need a specialized diffusion or transformer model like Sora that is trained on video data. You could potentially use an LLM run through Ollama to write a detailed script or prompt for Sora, but the actual video generation is outside Ollama's scope."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Sora available for public use in 2026, and can I run it locally like Ollama?",
      "answer": "As of early 2026, Sora is not widely available for public use; it is in a limited testing phase with select creators and researchers. Furthermore, Sora is a massive, proprietary model developed by OpenAI and is only accessible as a cloud-based API service. It cannot be downloaded or run locally on personal hardware like models via Ollama. Running Sora would require immense computational resources typically only available in large-scale data centers. Ollama's core advantage is local execution, which is not an option with Sora."
