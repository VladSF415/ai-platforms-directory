        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. It's known for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool.",
        "tidymodels (ml frameworks) is tidymodels is a comprehensive collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning that adheres to tidyverse design principles. It provides a unified, consistent, and expressive framework for the entire modeling workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment. Its unique value lies in its opinionated, user-friendly interface that reduces cognitive load for R users familiar with the tidyverse, promoting reproducibility and modern software engineering practices in statistical learning.. Users choose it for R, tidyverse, machine-learning."
