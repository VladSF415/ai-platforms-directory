        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
