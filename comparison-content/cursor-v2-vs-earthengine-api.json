      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Both platforms operate on a freemium model, but their structures and target users differ significantly. Cursor v2 offers a free tier with core AI features, likely limited by usage caps on premium model calls (Claude 3.7, GPT-5) or advanced agentic tasks. Its paid 'Pro' tier is aimed at professional developers and teams, offering higher limits, priority processing, and potentially team management features. The cost is associated with computational access to cutting-edge AI models.\n\nGoogle Earth Engine's freemium model is uniquely geared toward its mission. It provides completely free access for research, education, and non-profit use, including its massive data catalog and substantial computational resources. Commercial users, however, must apply for access and are billed based on computational usage (e.g., CPU time, data egress) via the Google Cloud Platform. This model makes it exceptionally accessible for academia while monetizing enterprise and commercial applications that require high-volume processing. For a researcher, GEE can be entirely free; for a large company, costs scale with analysis complexity and data export volume."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor v2 excels in features that augment the software development lifecycle. Its flagship capability is agentic code planning and execution, allowing it to undertake complex instructions like 'add user authentication' or 'migrate this codebase from Vue 2 to Vue 3'. Semantic search understands code context, not just text. One-click refactors and migrations automate tedious tasks. Deep LLM integration provides intelligent chat, explanations, and code generation. The built-in terminal and review tools consolidate the development environment.\n\nGoogle Earth Engine's features are all about geospatial data processing. Its crown jewel is the multi-petabyte, pre-processed satellite imagery catalog spanning 40+ years. The built-in parallel processing engine handles computations that would crash a local machine. The JavaScript and Python client APIs allow for scriptable, reproducible analysis. The web-based IDE (Code Editor) enables prototyping, visualization, and sharing. Key capabilities include change detection, time-series analysis, classification, and the export of maps, images, and videos. Its features are not about writing generic code but about writing code specifically to manipulate and understand geospatial data at scale."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Google Earth Engine to write a regular web application?",
      "answer": "No, you cannot. Google Earth Engine's JavaScript and Python APIs are specifically designed for interacting with its geospatial data catalog and processing functions. They include specialized objects for images, collections, and geometries, but lack the libraries and frameworks (like React, Express, Django) needed for general-purpose web development. It is an analysis platform, not a general software development environment. For building web apps, a tool like Cursor v2 with a standard IDE and runtime is required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Cursor v2 help me analyze satellite imagery or map deforestation?",
      "answer": "Not directly. Cursor v2 is an AI-powered code editor. It could potentially help you write the Python or JavaScript code that uses specialized geospatial libraries (like GDAL, rasterio, or even the Earth Engine client library) to perform such analysis on your own infrastructure and data. However, it does not provide access to satellite imagery data or the planetary-scale computational backend. For actual deforestation analysis, you would need the data and processing power of Google Earth Engine itself. Cursor might assist in scripting the logic, but Earth Engine provides the essential data and engine."
