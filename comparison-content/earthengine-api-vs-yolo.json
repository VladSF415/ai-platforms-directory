        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) (computer vision) is YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a groundbreaking real-time object detection system that applies a single convolutional neural network to the entire image, simultaneously predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in one forward pass. Its key capability is performing detection at high frame rates (e.g., 45-155 FPS depending on version) while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it uniquely efficient compared to traditional multi-stage detectors. It primarily targets developers and researchers in computer vision who need fast, deployable object detection for applications like video analysis, robotics, and autonomous systems.. Users choose it for object-detection, real-time-inference, convolutional-neural-networks."
