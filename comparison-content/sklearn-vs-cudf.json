        "cuDF (ml frameworks) is cuDF is a GPU-accelerated DataFrame library that provides a pandas-like API for high-performance data processing and analytics. It enables data scientists and engineers to execute data manipulation, transformation, and analysis workloads on NVIDIA GPUs, delivering order-of-magnitude speedups over CPU-based pandas for large datasets. Its uniqueness lies in its seamless integration into the RAPIDS ecosystem, allowing end-to-end GPU acceleration of data science pipelines without requiring deep CUDA expertise.. Users choose it for gpu-dataframes, pandas-api, nvidia-rapids."
