        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "MLflow (ml frameworks) is MLflow is an open-source platform that manages the complete machine learning lifecycle from experimentation to production. It provides tools for experiment tracking, reproducible runs, model packaging, and centralized model registry, enabling teams to collaborate effectively on ML projects. Its framework-agnostic design allows integration with any ML library, making it uniquely versatile across diverse ML ecosystems.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, model-registry."
