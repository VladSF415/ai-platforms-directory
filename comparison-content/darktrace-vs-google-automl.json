        "Darktrace is Darktrace is an enterprise cybersecurity platform that uses self-learning AI to autonomously detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats across networks, email, cloud, and industrial environments. Its core technology, modeled on the human immune system, learns the normal 'pattern of life' for an organization to identify subtle deviations indicative of novel attacks, insider threats, and ransomware. This makes it uniquely capable of stopping in-progress threats that evade traditional rule-based security tools.. It's known for cybersecurity, autonomous-response, network-security.",
        "Google AutoML, on the other hand, is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. Users choose it for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud."
