        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Albumentations (computer vision) is Albumentations is a high-performance, open-source Python library for image augmentation, designed specifically for deep learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of efficient, optimized image transformations (geometric, color, and pixel-level) that are crucial for training robust neural networks. Its key differentiator is its exceptional speed and flexibility, offering a unified API that works seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other frameworks, making it a de facto standard in research and production pipelines.. Users choose it for image-augmentation, data-preprocessing, pytorch-integration."
