      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor and OpenCV reflect their fundamentally different natures as commercial software versus open-source library. Cursor operates on a freemium model with a free tier offering basic AI features and paid plans (starting at $20/month) providing advanced capabilities like unlimited AI usage, priority support, and enterprise features. This subscription-based approach funds ongoing development of the AI integration and editor enhancements. OpenCV, being completely open-source under the Apache 2 license, has no direct cost for usage—developers can download, modify, and distribute it freely. However, organizations may incur costs through commercial support contracts, training, or custom development services offered by the OpenCV organization and third-party providers. For large-scale commercial deployments, companies often budget for implementation support and maintenance despite the zero licensing cost."
