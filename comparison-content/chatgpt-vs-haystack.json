        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Haystack (ml frameworks) is Haystack is an open-source framework by deepset for building production-ready natural language search systems and question-answering applications. It enables developers to create end-to-end NLP pipelines that can retrieve, process, and generate answers from large document collections using state-of-the-art language models. What makes it unique is its modular pipeline architecture that seamlessly integrates with various document stores (Elasticsearch, Weaviate, FAISS) and supports both sparse and dense retrieval methods alongside generative models.. Users choose it for retrieval-augmented-generation, document-search, question-answering."
