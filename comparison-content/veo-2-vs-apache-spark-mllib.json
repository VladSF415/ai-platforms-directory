        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Apache Spark MLlib (analytics bi) is Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable, distributed machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, designed to handle massive datasets across clusters. It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
