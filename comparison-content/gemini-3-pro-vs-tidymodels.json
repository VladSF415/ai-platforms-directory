        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "tidymodels (ml frameworks) is tidymodels is a comprehensive collection of R packages for modeling and machine learning that adheres to tidyverse design principles. It provides a unified, consistent, and expressive framework for the entire modeling workflow, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, tuning, evaluation, and deployment. Its unique value lies in its opinionated, user-friendly interface that reduces cognitive load for R users familiar with the tidyverse, promoting reproducibility and modern software engineering practices in statistical learning.. Users choose it for R, tidyverse, machine-learning."
