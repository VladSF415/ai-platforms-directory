        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "OpenCV (computer vision) is OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a foundational, open-source library for real-time computer vision and machine learning. It provides over 2,500 optimized algorithms for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, motion tracking, and image stitching, with interfaces in C++, Python, and Java. Its unique value lies in its massive community adoption, extensive documentation, and robust performance across desktop, mobile (iOS/Android), and embedded systems, making it the de facto standard for both academic research and industrial applications.. Users choose it for computer-vision, image-processing, object-detection."
