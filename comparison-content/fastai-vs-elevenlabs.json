      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models are starkly different, reflecting their core philosophies. Fast.ai is completely open-source and free. There are no usage fees, tiered plans, or credits. The cost is the computational resources (e.g., GPUs) required to run the training, which can be significant for large models but is independent of the library itself. This makes it ideal for learning, research, and projects with budget constraints. ElevenLabs operates on a freemium SaaS model. It offers a free tier with limited characters per month and basic features. Paid plans (Starting, Creator, Pro, Scale) introduce higher character quotas, access to more voices, advanced voice cloning, and priority API access. Costs scale with usage (characters generated), making it predictable for production workloads but an ongoing operational expense. For 2026, Fast.ai wins on pure software cost, while ElevenLabs offers a scalable service for professional audio generation."
