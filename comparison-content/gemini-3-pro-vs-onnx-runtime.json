        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "ONNX Runtime (ml frameworks) is ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine for machine learning models in the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) format. It accelerates model execution across diverse hardware (CPUs, GPUs, specialized accelerators) via a unified interface to vendor-specific libraries. Its unique value lies in enabling framework-agnostic, production-ready deployment with maximal hardware utilization through a flexible provider system.. Users choose it for model-inference, cross-platform, hardware-acceleration."
