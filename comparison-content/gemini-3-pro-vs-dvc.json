        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "DVC (Data Version Control) (ml frameworks) is DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system specifically designed for machine learning projects, enabling Git-like operations for large datasets, models, and experiments. It provides data versioning, experiment tracking, and reproducible pipeline management while maintaining seamless integration with Git for code. What makes it unique is its ability to handle large files and datasets efficiently while keeping the familiar Git workflow, making ML projects as reproducible and collaborative as software development.. Users choose it for mlops, data-versioning, experiment-tracking."
