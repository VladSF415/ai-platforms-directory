        "AWS SageMaker Autopilot is Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is an automated machine learning (AutoML) service that automatically builds, trains, and tunes machine learning models based on your data, while providing full visibility into the underlying processes and candidate models. It is designed for data scientists and developers who want to accelerate model creation without sacrificing control or transparency. Its key differentiator is the combination of full automation with complete visibility into the generated notebooks, feature engineering steps, and model leaderboard, allowing for expert review and customization.. It's known for automl, aws, machine-learning.",
        "Darktrace, on the other hand, is Darktrace is an enterprise cybersecurity platform that uses self-learning AI to autonomously detect, investigate, and respond to cyber threats across networks, email, cloud, and industrial environments. Its core technology, modeled on the human immune system, learns the normal 'pattern of life' for an organization to identify subtle deviations indicative of novel attacks, insider threats, and ransomware. This makes it uniquely capable of stopping in-progress threats that evade traditional rule-based security tools.. Users choose it for cybersecurity, autonomous-response, network-security."
