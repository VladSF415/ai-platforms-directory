        "fairseq is Fairseq is a PyTorch-based, open-source sequence modeling toolkit developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) that enables researchers and engineers to train custom models for a wide array of NLP tasks. Its key capabilities include state-of-the-art support for translation, summarization, language modeling, and other text generation tasks, featuring highly optimized implementations of Transformer architectures. It is particularly unique for its research-first design, offering extensive pre-trained models, modular components for easy experimentation, and scalability across multiple GPUs and nodes, making it a foundational tool for advancing NLP research.. It's known for PyTorch, Transformer Models, Text Generation.",
        "Rasa, on the other hand, is Rasa is an open-source framework for building production-ready, contextual AI assistants and chatbots. Its core capabilities include highly customizable natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management, enabling developers to create assistants that handle complex, multi-turn conversations. It is uniquely designed for developers and enterprises that require full data control, the ability to run on-premises or in private clouds, and deep customization beyond simple rule-based bots.. Users choose it for conversational-ai, chatbot-framework, nlp-framework."
