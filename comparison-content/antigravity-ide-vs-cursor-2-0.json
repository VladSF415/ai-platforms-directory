      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Pricing is a major differentiator. Antigravity IDE is currently completely free during its preview period, offering full access to its groundbreaking multi-agent system, browser automation, and support for top-tier AI models without any cost barrier. This makes it an incredibly attractive option for individual developers, students, and early adopters. However, its long-term pricing strategy post-preview remains undefined.\n\nCursor 2.0 operates on a freemium model. It offers a capable free tier suitable for many individual developers, with paid plans (Pro, Business) that unlock advanced features like more powerful autonomous agents, increased usage limits, and enhanced collaboration tools for teams. This provides a clear upgrade path for professionals and organizations that require reliable, scalable AI assistance within their workflow, with the assurance of a sustainable business model supporting ongoing development."
