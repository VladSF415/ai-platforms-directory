It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
