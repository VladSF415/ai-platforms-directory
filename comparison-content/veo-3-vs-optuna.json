        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Optuna (ml frameworks) is Optuna is an open-source, automatic hyperparameter optimization framework designed specifically for machine learning. Its key capabilities include defining search spaces with a dynamic, Pythonic API and employing efficient sampling and pruning algorithms to accelerate the tuning process. It is unique for its 'define-by-run' paradigm, which allows for dynamic construction of parameter spaces, making it highly flexible and favored by researchers and engineers for complex optimization tasks.. Users choose it for hyperparameter-optimization, automl, bayesian-optimization."
