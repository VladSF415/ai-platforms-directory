        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "MMDetection (computer vision) is MMDetection is an open-source object detection toolbox and benchmark built on PyTorch, designed to provide a unified and modular framework for training, evaluating, and deploying a wide variety of detection algorithms. Its key capabilities include supporting numerous state-of-the-art models for object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation, all while emphasizing high performance and code reusability. It is uniquely positioned due to its comprehensive model zoo, rigorous benchmarking, and its role as a core component of the broader OpenMMLab ecosystem for computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, panoptic-segmentation."
