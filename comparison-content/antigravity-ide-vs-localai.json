        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "LocalAI (generative ai) is LocalAI is a self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible API server that enables users to run large language models (LLMs), generate images, and transcribe audio locally on their own hardware. Its key capabilities include providing a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API, supporting a wide range of open-source models, and operating entirely offline for enhanced privacy and data control. It uniquely targets developers, researchers, and privacy-conscious individuals who want the power of generative AI without relying on external cloud services or incurring API costs.. Users choose it for self-hosted, openai-compatible, local-inference."
