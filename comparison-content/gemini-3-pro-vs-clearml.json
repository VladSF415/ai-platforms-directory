        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "ClearML (llm ops) is ClearML is an open-source, end-to-end MLOps platform designed to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle. It provides a unified suite for experiment tracking, orchestration of training pipelines, dataset versioning, model registry, and production deployment. Its key differentiator is its 'auto-magical' integration that automatically logs experiments, code, and artifacts with minimal code changes, making it highly popular with data scientists and ML engineers for its ease of adoption and powerful automation.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, pipeline-orchestration."
