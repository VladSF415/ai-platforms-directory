      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Both Hugging Face Transformers and Detectron2 are fundamentally open-source projects released under permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 for Transformers, Apache 2.0 for Detectron2), meaning the core libraries are free to use, modify, and distribute. The primary 'cost' consideration involves computational resources and potential managed services. Training and deploying large transformer models from Hugging Face can incur significant cloud GPU/TPU costs, especially for models with billions of parameters. Similarly, training high-accuracy Detectron2 models on large-scale image datasets requires substantial GPU memory and time.\n\nHugging Face offers a commercial platform (Hub, Spaces, Endpoints) with tiered pricing for team collaboration, private model hosting, and serverless inference endpoints, adding a SaaS layer on top of the free library. Detectron2 remains a pure library without official managed services, though it can be deployed via various cloud ML platforms. For 2025, the total cost of ownership heavily depends on scale, with Hugging Face providing more turnkey commercial options, while Detectron2 demands more in-house infrastructure expertise."
