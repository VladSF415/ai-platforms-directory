        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Google Cloud Vision API (computer vision) is Google Cloud Vision API is a fully managed, pre-trained machine learning service that enables developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into applications without requiring deep ML expertise. Its key capabilities include detecting objects, faces, landmarks, logos, and text (OCR) within images, as well as filtering explicit content and generating image metadata. It uniquely leverages Google's massive-scale, proprietary datasets and research to deliver high-accuracy, production-ready models accessible via a simple REST API, making it a top choice for enterprises and developers needing reliable, scalable computer vision.. Users choose it for image-analysis, optical-character-recognition, object-detection."
