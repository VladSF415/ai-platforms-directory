        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "MediaPipe (computer vision) is MediaPipe is an open-source framework by Google for building multimodal perception pipelines that process synchronized time-series data like video, audio, and sensor streams. It provides developers with production-ready, cross-platform solutions for real-time inference, featuring pre-built models for tasks such as face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and object detection. Its unique value lies in its highly optimized, low-latency architecture designed to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones, web browsers, and edge devices, abstracting away complex hardware acceleration details.. Users choose it for google, perception-pipelines, real-time-inference."
