        "Sora 2 (generative ai) is Sora 2 is OpenAI's latest text-to-video generation model that creates high-quality, realistic videos up to 20 seconds long from text prompts or images. Released in September 2025, it features synchronized dialogue, ambient sound effects, and background music generated natively alongside video. Its key differentiator is the ability to generate cinematic, physically accurate videos with native audio in multiple styles including realistic, anime, and stylized formats.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, ai-video.",
        "Google BERT (nlp) is Google BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking pre-trained language model that fundamentally advanced natural language processing by enabling deep bidirectional context understanding. Its key capability is generating contextualized word embeddings, allowing it to interpret the meaning of a word based on all surrounding words in a sentence, which significantly improved performance on tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis. What makes it unique is its transformer-based architecture and the 'masked language model' pre-training objective, which set a new standard for NLP research and practical applications, making it a foundational model for both researchers and developers.. Users choose it for transformer-model, language-model, pre-trained-embeddings."
