      "title": "Overview",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor is an AI-native code editor built as a fork of VS Code. Its primary goal is to deeply embed artificial intelligence into the software development lifecycle for individual developers and small teams. It functions as an intelligent 'pair programmer,' allowing you to chat with AI about your codebase, issue high-level commands for features, and receive context-aware completions and edits. Cursor's magic lies in its deep integration—it indexes your repository to provide semantic understanding, enabling actions and answers based on your entire project's context, not just the current file.",
        "AutoGen, developed by Microsoft Research, is not an editor but a Python framework for orchestrating multi-agent conversations. It provides the building blocks to create, manage, and coordinate multiple AI agents, each with defined roles (like Assistant, UserProxy), capabilities, and tools. These agents converse with each other and with human users to collaboratively solve complex tasks that require reasoning, code execution, and tool use. AutoGen is for developers building automated systems, such as automated research assistants, complex coding assistants, or sophisticated workflow engines, where a single AI agent is insufficient."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor and AutoGen reflect their different target users and distribution methods. Cursor operates on a freemium model. It offers a free tier with limited usage of its advanced AI features (like Agent Mode and extensive codebase queries), while its paid 'Pro' plan provides higher rate limits, priority access to the latest models (like GPT-4 and Claude 3), and more extensive codebase indexing. This model is typical for end-user SaaS products. AutoGen, being an open-source framework, has no direct cost for the software itself. The primary expense comes from the usage of the underlying LLM APIs (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) that you configure the agents to use. This makes AutoGen's cost variable and dependent on the scale and complexity of the agent systems you build. You also bear the infrastructure costs for hosting and running your AutoGen applications."

      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor's features are centered on the integrated developer experience: AI Chat in Editor for direct Q&A, Agent Mode for executing multi-file tasks from natural language, Intelligent Completions that understand project context, and Edit/Diff Generation for safe, previewable code changes. Its strength is its seamless, context-aware assistance within the coding environment. AutoGen's capabilities are architectural: Customizable Conversable Agents that you program, built-in patterns for roles and group chats, seamless code execution and human-in-the-loop feedback within conversations, and extensible tool use for calling functions and APIs. Its power is in flexibility and orchestration, allowing you to design complex agentic workflows that a single AI, like the one in Cursor, could not handle alone."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use AutoGen to build a tool like Cursor?",
      "answer": "Technically, yes, but it would be a massive undertaking. AutoGen provides the underlying multi-agent orchestration framework. You could, in principle, use it to create agents that perform code analysis, editing, and planning similar to Cursor's Agent Mode. However, you would need to build the entire IDE integration, user interface, codebase indexing system, and editor tooling from scratch. Cursor is a polished, end-user product built on top of similar AI capabilities. AutoGen is the low-level toolkit you would use to create the 'brain' of such a system, but not the entire application itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cursor suitable for large enterprise teams or complex software projects?",
      "answer": "Cursor can be very effective for individual developers and small teams within a larger enterprise, especially for accelerating work on specific modules or features. Its codebase indexing and multi-file awareness help manage complexity. However, for governing AI usage across large teams, ensuring code security and compliance, and integrating with enterprise-grade CI/CD pipelines, organizations might find its current freemium SaaS model and lack of extensive administrative controls limiting. For large-scale, regulated environments, a framework like AutoGen deployed on internal infrastructure might offer more control, though it requires significant in-house development effort. Cursor is best seen as a powerful productivity booster for developers, not necessarily a centralized enterprise development platform."
