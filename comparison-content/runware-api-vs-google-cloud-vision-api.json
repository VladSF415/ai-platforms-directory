        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2025, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. It's known for api, image-generation, video-generation.",
        "Google Cloud Vision API (computer vision) is Google Cloud Vision API is a fully managed, pre-trained machine learning service that enables developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into applications without requiring deep ML expertise. Its key capabilities include detecting objects, faces, landmarks, logos, and text (OCR) within images, as well as filtering explicit content and generating image metadata. It uniquely leverages Google's massive-scale, proprietary datasets and research to deliver high-accuracy, production-ready models accessible via a simple REST API, making it a top choice for enterprises and developers needing reliable, scalable computer vision.. Users choose it for image-analysis, optical-character-recognition, object-detection."
