        "Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed explicitly for deep learning experimentation. Its primary goal is to enable developers and researchers to move from idea to result with the least possible delay. Keras achieves this through a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the underlying complexities of tensor operations and gradient computation. A key differentiator is its multi-backend support, allowing models to run seamlessly on TensorFlow, JAX, or PyTorch. This makes Keras a framework-agnostic tool beloved in the ML community for prototyping, education, and production model development, particularly in computer vision and NLP."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Antigravity and Keras reflect their different development philosophies and target users. Antigravity is currently offered completely free during its preview phase, which began with its late 2025 launch. This provides unprecedented access to its advanced multi-agent AI capabilities, integrated browser automation, and support for the latest commercial LLMs at no cost, though a future paid tier is likely post-preview. Keras, in contrast, is fundamentally open-source software released under the MIT license. It is free to use, modify, and distribute for any purpose, including commercial applications. There are no licensing fees. However, costs can be associated with the underlying backends (like TensorFlow Enterprise support) or the computational resources required for training large models. For pure software access, both are free, but Antigravity's model is a temporary preview, while Keras's open-source nature is permanent."

Its elegant API, framework-agnostic design, and focus on rapid prototyping make it the most efficient way to go from a neural network idea to a trained, deployable model. The strength of its community, depth of documentation, and production deployment pathways give it a maturity and reliability that is critical for serious ML work.\n\nOur final recommendation is clear: If you are a software developer looking to supercharge your coding workflow with collaborative AI, choose Antigravity IDE. If you are a machine learning practitioner building neural networks, choose Keras. They are both leaders in their respective domains, and the best 'tool' is the one specifically designed for the job you need to do. Trying to use Antigravity for deep learning model architecture would be as inefficient as trying to use Keras to build a web application's frontend—each excels in its designed purpose.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Antigravity IDE for machine learning or data science projects?",
      "answer": "While Antigravity IDE is a powerful general-purpose code editor with AI assistance, it is not specifically designed as a machine learning framework. You could certainly use it to write Python scripts that utilize libraries like Scikit-learn or even Keras/TensorFlow, as it's a full IDE. However, it lacks the specialized built-in features for model prototyping, training loops, and visualization that Keras provides. For pure ML model development, Keras within a traditional IDE (like VS Code or PyCharm) would be more efficient. Antigravity's strength is in automating the broader software development process around an ML project, not in replacing the ML framework itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Keras being replaced by newer AI coding tools like Antigravity?",
      "answer": "No, Keras is not being replaced. They serve fundamentally different layers of the technology stack. Keras is a domain-specific library (DSL) for deep learning, a tool for mathematically defining and training neural networks. Antigravity is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) enhanced with AI agents, a tool for writing and managing code across all types of software projects. In fact, they can be complementary: a developer could use Antigravity IDE to write, organize, and manage the broader application code, while using the Keras library within that project to implement the machine learning components. Antigravity automates coding tasks; Keras simplifies model building. They are not in direct competition."
