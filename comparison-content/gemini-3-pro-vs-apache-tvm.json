        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Apache TVM (llm ops) is Apache TVM is an open-source deep learning compiler stack that compiles models from various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.) into optimized machine code for diverse hardware backends including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized ML accelerators. Its key capability is automatic optimization through machine learning-based auto-tuning, enabling high-performance inference across edge devices, cloud servers, and custom hardware. What makes it unique is its hardware-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that allows a single model to be deployed efficiently across dozens of different hardware targets.. Users choose it for deep-learning-compiler, model-optimization, hardware-agnostic."
