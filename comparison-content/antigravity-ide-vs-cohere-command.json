        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Cohere Command (llms) is Cohere Command is a suite of enterprise-grade large language models (LLMs) accessible via API, designed for building production-ready AI applications. It specializes in high-quality text generation, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with a strong focus on data privacy, security, and developer experience. Its unique value lies in offering powerful, fast, and steerable models that are optimized for business use cases, often positioned as a robust alternative to other leading LLM providers.. Users choose it for large-language-models, text-generation, semantic-search."
