        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "GeoPandas (analytics bi) is GeoPandas is an open-source Python library that extends the data manipulation capabilities of pandas to enable working with geospatial data. It adds support for geometric types and spatial operations, allowing users to perform GIS (Geographic Information Systems) tasks directly within a familiar pandas-like DataFrame environment. Its unique value lies in seamlessly integrating geometric objects with tabular data, making complex geospatial analysis accessible to data scientists and analysts without requiring specialized GIS software.. Users choose it for geospatial-analysis, python-library, gis."
