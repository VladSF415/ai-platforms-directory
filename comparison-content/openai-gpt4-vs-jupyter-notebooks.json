      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models are fundamentally different, reflecting their core nature. ChatGPT (GPT-4o) operates on a freemium model. A capable free tier with usage limits is available, while the paid 'Plus' subscription ($20/month) offers priority access, higher usage caps, and early features. For developers and businesses, the OpenAI API usage is pay-as-you-go, billed per token (input and output), with GPT-4o being significantly more cost-effective than its predecessor. This creates a variable cost structure that scales with usage.\n\nJupyter Notebooks is completely open-source and free to use. There are no licensing fees. Costs are incurred indirectly through the infrastructure needed to run it (e.g., personal computer, cloud server, or managed service like Google Colab, which may have free tiers and paid upgrades for compute power and storage). The total cost of ownership for Jupyter is tied to computational resources and optional commercial support/services from third-party vendors, not the software itself."
