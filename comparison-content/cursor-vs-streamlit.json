        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
        "Streamlit (ml frameworks) is Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to transform data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes, without requiring front-end web development skills. Its key capability is turning Python scripts into interactive apps with widgets, visualizations, and data caching through a simple declarative API. What makes it unique is its rapid development cycle with hot-reloading, a growing ecosystem of community-built components, and seamless integration with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.. Users choose it for python-framework, data-apps, prototyping."
