        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "llama.cpp (llms) is llama.cpp is a high-performance, open-source C/C++ port of Meta's LLaMA and Llama 2 language models, designed to enable efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) directly on CPU-based hardware. Its key capabilities include advanced quantization, memory optimization, and cross-platform support, allowing models to run on commodity hardware without requiring a dedicated GPU. It uniquely targets developers and researchers seeking to deploy or experiment with LLMs in resource-constrained environments, from laptops to servers, with minimal dependencies.. Users choose it for cpu-inference, model-quantization, open-source-llm."
