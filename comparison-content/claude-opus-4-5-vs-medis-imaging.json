        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Medis Medical Imaging (healthcare ai) is Medis Medical Imaging provides advanced, vendor-independent software for the quantitative analysis of cardiac images from CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Ultrasound. Its core capability is delivering precise, reproducible measurements of cardiac structure and function (like vessel dimensions, plaque volume, and ventricular strain) to support clinical decision-making and research. It is uniquely trusted by leading hospitals, core labs, and pharmaceutical companies for its 30+ years of scientific validation and its proprietary technologies like QFR (Quantitative Flow Ratio).. Users choose it for cardiac-imaging, medical-image-analysis, quantitative-cardiology."
