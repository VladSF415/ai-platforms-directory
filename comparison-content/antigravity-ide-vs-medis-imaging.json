        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Medis Medical Imaging (healthcare ai) is Medis Medical Imaging provides advanced, vendor-independent software for the quantitative analysis of cardiac images from CT, MRI, X-Ray, and Ultrasound. Its core capability is delivering precise, reproducible measurements of cardiac structure and function (like vessel dimensions, plaque volume, and ventricular strain) to support clinical decision-making and research. It is uniquely trusted by leading hospitals, core labs, and pharmaceutical companies for its 30+ years of scientific validation and its proprietary technologies like QFR (Quantitative Flow Ratio).. Users choose it for cardiac-imaging, medical-image-analysis, quantitative-cardiology."
