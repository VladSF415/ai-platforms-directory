      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor 2.0 follows a freemium model with a free tier that includes basic AI assistance and limited access to cloud models. The paid Pro tier (approximately $20/month as of 2026) provides unlimited access to advanced AI features, priority access to the latest models, increased context windows, and enhanced agent capabilities. Enterprise plans offer additional features like team management, advanced security controls, and dedicated support. The pricing reflects its position as a professional development tool with ongoing costs for cloud model usage.\n\nAutoGen is completely open-source and free to use, with no licensing fees or subscription costs. However, users must bear the costs of the underlying LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, etc.) and any infrastructure required to run the framework. This makes AutoGen potentially more cost-effective for organizations with existing infrastructure and technical expertise, though it requires more setup and maintenance effort compared to Cursor's managed service. The total cost of ownership for AutoGen depends heavily on the scale of deployment and choice of AI models."
