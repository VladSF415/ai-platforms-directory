      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models of OpenCV and ElevenLabs are fundamentally different, reflecting their open-source versus commercial SaaS natures. OpenCV is completely free and open-source under an Apache 2 license. There are no usage fees, tier limits, or paywalls for the core library. This makes it accessible for any project, from student theses to large-scale enterprise deployments, though users must handle their own infrastructure and support. ElevenLabs operates on a freemium model. It offers a free tier with limited monthly character generation and basic features, suitable for experimentation. Paid plans (Starting, Creator, Pro, Scale) introduce higher character limits, access to more voices and languages, professional voice cloning, and advanced features like speech-to-speech. Pricing scales with usage, making it cost-effective for small projects but potentially expensive for high-volume, commercial audio production."
