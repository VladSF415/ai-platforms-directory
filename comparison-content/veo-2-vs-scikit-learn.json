        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Scikit-learn (ml frameworks) is Scikit-learn is a foundational open-source Python library for machine learning, providing a consistent and accessible API for implementing a wide range of classical supervised and unsupervised algorithms. It is specifically designed for practical data analysis and modeling, featuring robust tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and selection. Its key differentiator is its exceptional ease of use, well-documented API, and deep integration with the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, pandas), making it the de facto standard for classical ML in academia and industry prototyping.. Users choose it for Python, Classical Machine Learning, Supervised Learning."
