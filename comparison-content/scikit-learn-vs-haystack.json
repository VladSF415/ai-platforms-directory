It enables developers to create end-to-end NLP pipelines that can retrieve, process, and generate answers from large document collections using state-of-the-art language models. What makes it unique is its modular pipeline architecture that seamlessly integrates with various document stores (Elasticsearch, Weaviate, FAISS) and supports both sparse and dense retrieval methods alongside generative models.. Users choose it for retrieval-augmented-generation, document-search, question-answering."
