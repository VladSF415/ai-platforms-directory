        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
        "PEFT (ml frameworks) is PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a Hugging Face library that enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, drastically reducing computational and memory costs. It provides state-of-the-art methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and Adapters, making it uniquely suited for researchers and practitioners who need to customize models for specific tasks without full retraining. Its seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the go-to tool for parameter-efficient transfer learning.. Users choose it for parameter-efficient-fine-tuning, lora, adapters."
