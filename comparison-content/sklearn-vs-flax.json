        "Flax (ml frameworks) is Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX, designed for flexible and expressive machine learning research and production. It provides a functional, immutable approach to model definition and training, leveraging JAX's automatic differentiation and XLA compilation for speed. Its key differentiator is a clean, research-friendly API that balances flexibility for experimentation with the ability to scale to large models and datasets, making it a popular choice within the JAX ecosystem.. Users choose it for JAX, Neural-Networks, Functional-Programming."
