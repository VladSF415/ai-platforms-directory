        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
