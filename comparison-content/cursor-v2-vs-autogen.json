      "title": "Overview",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor v2 is a commercial, freemium AI code editor that integrates state-of-the-art models like Claude 3.7 and GPT-5 directly into the development environment. Its primary value proposition is an 'agentic' architecture that can autonomously plan and execute complex code changes—such as refactors, migrations, or feature additions—across an entire repository. It functions as an ultra-intelligent pair programmer with deep context, offering semantic search, one-click operations, and built-in tools like a terminal. It is an end-user application focused on boosting individual and team coding productivity within a unified interface.",
        "AutoGen is an open-source Python framework from Microsoft Research designed for building customizable multi-agent conversation systems. It is not an end-user application but a developer toolkit for creating, managing, and orchestrating teams of AI agents. Each agent can have a specialized role (e.g., coder, critic, executor), custom capabilities, and access to tools. AutoGen's unique strength is facilitating structured dialogues between these agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks that require reasoning, code execution, and iterative problem-solving, with seamless integration for human oversight and feedback."

      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Cursor v2 and AutoGen reflect their different target audiences and distribution strategies. Cursor v2 operates on a freemium model, offering a capable free tier for individual developers with limitations on advanced AI model usage (like GPT-5) or premium features such as extensive agentic planning. Paid professional or team plans are required for commercial use, unlimited AI queries, and enterprise-level support, representing a recurring SaaS cost. AutoGen, being open-source (MIT licensed), is fundamentally free to use and modify. The primary costs associated with AutoGen are the operational expenses for running the LLM backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, etc.) that power the agents and the infrastructure to host the orchestration framework. For organizations, AutoGen offers greater long-term cost control and avoidance of vendor lock-in but requires significant in-house development and MLOps expertise to build, deploy, and maintain production systems."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can AutoGen be used as a code editor like Cursor v2?",
      "answer": "No, AutoGen cannot function as a standalone code editor. It is a Python framework for orchestrating conversational AI agents. While one of its powerful use cases is code generation and execution (via specialized agents), it lacks the integrated editor interface, file management, syntax highlighting, and direct editing features of Cursor v2. You would typically build an AutoGen system that includes a coding agent, but you would interact with it and view its output through a separate interface (like a Jupyter notebook, CLI, or a custom web app), not a dedicated IDE."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use Cursor v2 to build a multi-agent system like AutoGen?",
      "answer": "Not directly. Cursor v2 is designed as an intelligent code editor with a powerful, integrated AI agent. While this agent can plan and execute complex coding tasks, it operates as a single, unified assistant within the context of your codebase. It is not architected to allow you to define, manage, and orchestrate multiple independent AI agents with different roles, personalities, and tools that converse with each other—which is the core capability of AutoGen. Cursor is for enhancing development; AutoGen is for building custom agentic applications."
