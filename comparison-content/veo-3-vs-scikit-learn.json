        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Scikit-learn (ml frameworks) is Scikit-learn is a foundational open-source Python library for machine learning, providing a consistent and accessible API for implementing a wide range of classical supervised and unsupervised algorithms. It is specifically designed for practical data analysis and modeling, featuring robust tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and selection. Its key differentiator is its exceptional ease of use, well-documented API, and deep integration with the scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, pandas), making it the de facto standard for classical ML in academia and industry prototyping.. Users choose it for Python, Classical Machine Learning, Supervised Learning."
