        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "Khan Academy AI (generative ai) is Khan Academy AI is a non-profit educational platform that leverages artificial intelligence to provide personalized, mastery-based learning experiences. Its key capabilities include adaptive exercises, real-time progress tracking, and an AI-powered tutoring assistant (Khanmigo) that offers step-by-step guidance and Socratic dialogue. It uniquely serves a global audience of students, teachers, and parents with a completely free core curriculum, distinguishing it from commercial adaptive learning platforms.. Users choose it for adaptive-learning, k-12-education, ai-tutoring."
