        "CrewAI is CrewAI is an open-source framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents that collaborate in a structured crew to complete complex tasks. It enables developers to define specialized agents with roles, goals, and tools, and chain them together through processes for sequential, hierarchical, or consensual task execution. It uniquely focuses on multi-agent collaboration, inter-agent delegation, and human-in-the-loop oversight, targeting developers building sophisticated AI-driven workflows.. It's known for multi-agent-systems, autonomous-agents, workflow-orchestration.",
        "Semantic Kernel, on the other hand, is Semantic Kernel is an open-source Software Development Kit (SDK) from Microsoft that enables developers to seamlessly integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) from services like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and others into conventional programming applications (C#, Python, Java). Its key capability is providing a flexible, plugin-based architecture to orchestrate AI services, manage prompts, access native skills, and handle memory, allowing developers to build sophisticated, AI-augmented agents and copilots. It uniquely bridges the gap between traditional application logic and generative AI by treating prompts and native code as composable 'skills' or 'plugins' within a cohesive 'kernel,' making it a powerful framework for agentic and multi-step AI workflows.. Users choose it for microsoft, open-source, llm-orchestration."

This makes it ideal for teams that need multi-agent-systems.",
        "Semantic Kernel stands out with: Multi-language SDK support (C#, Python, Java) with consistent abstractions, Planner for dynamically creating and executing multi-step AI plans/pipelines, Plugin architecture for packaging native code functions and semantic prompts as reusable skills. It's particularly strong for users focused on microsoft."
