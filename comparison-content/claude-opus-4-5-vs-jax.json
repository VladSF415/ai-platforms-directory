        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "JAX (ml frameworks) is JAX is a high-performance Python library for numerical computing and machine learning research that provides composable function transformations. It combines NumPy's familiar API with automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation via XLA, and automatic vectorization/parallelization capabilities. What makes it unique is its functional programming paradigm and ability to efficiently scale computations across GPUs and TPUs while maintaining mathematical purity.. Users choose it for Google, XLA, automatic-differentiation."
