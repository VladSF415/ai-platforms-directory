        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Streamlit (ml frameworks) is Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to transform data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes, without requiring front-end web development skills. Its key capability is turning Python scripts into interactive apps with widgets, visualizations, and data caching through a simple declarative API. What makes it unique is its rapid development cycle with hot-reloading, a growing ecosystem of community-built components, and seamless integration with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.. Users choose it for python-framework, data-apps, prototyping."
