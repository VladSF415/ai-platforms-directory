      "title": "Features & Capabilities",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Cursor's feature set revolves around code intelligence and developer productivity. Its AI Chat in Editor allows developers to converse with AI about their codebase, asking questions and receiving explanations in context. The Agent Mode enables high-level natural language commands where the AI plans and executes changes across multiple files—like adding authentication or refactoring components. Intelligent completions go beyond standard autocomplete by understanding project-specific patterns and libraries. The Edit & Diff Generation feature (Cmd/Ctrl + K) lets users instruct AI to modify selected code, with previewable changes before acceptance. Codebase indexing gives the AI semantic understanding of entire repositories, while multi-file awareness ensures actions consider broader project context. VS Code compatibility maintains familiar workflows while adding AI superpowers.\n\nMidjourney's capabilities focus entirely on visual creation and manipulation. Its core function is text-to-image generation through Discord commands, where users describe what they want to create. Advanced upscaling transforms initial generations into higher-resolution images, while variation creation ('V' buttons) produces alternative versions of selected images. Remix mode allows prompt modification during regeneration for iterative refinement. Parameters like --ar control aspect ratios, --s adjust stylization, and --w influence 'weirdness' for more unexpected results. The platform includes a community gallery for inspiration and sharing, and paid subscribers receive commercial usage rights for generated images. Unlike Cursor's code-specific features, Midjourney's tools are all oriented toward controlling and refining visual output."
