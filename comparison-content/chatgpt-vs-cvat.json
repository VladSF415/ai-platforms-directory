        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "CVAT (computer vision) is CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the efficient annotation of images and videos for computer vision projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D data labeling, supports team collaboration, and is built with extensibility in mind through its API and SDK. What makes it unique is its powerful interpolation for video annotation, native support for complex tasks like point clouds and 3D cuboids, and its origin as an Intel project, ensuring robust performance and active development for industrial-scale AI data pipelines.. Users choose it for data-labeling, video-annotation, point-cloud."
