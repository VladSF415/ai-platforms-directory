        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
        "TensorRT (ml frameworks) is TensorRT is NVIDIA's high-performance deep learning inference SDK and runtime, designed to optimize and deploy trained models for production. It provides layer fusion, precision calibration, and kernel auto-tuning to maximize throughput and minimize latency on NVIDIA GPUs. It uniquely delivers deterministic, hardware-aware optimizations that are critical for real-time applications in autonomous systems, recommendation engines, and large-scale AI services.. Users choose it for nvidia, gpu-inference, model-optimization."
