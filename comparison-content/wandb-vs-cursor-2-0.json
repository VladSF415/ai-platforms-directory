It transcends being a simple coding assistant and becomes a collaborative partner that understands your codebase's full context. Its ability to execute complex refactors and feature implementations through natural language promises a significant paradigm shift in developer productivity and code maintenance.\n\n**Recommendation:** Do you build and train machine learning models? Choose Weights & Biases. Do you build applications, services, and software systems? Choose Cursor 2.0. In advanced teams, a full-stack engineer might use Cursor 2.0 to build the application infrastructure and a data scientist might use Weights & Biases to develop and deploy the models that power features within that same application. The most forward-looking organizations will leverage both tools in tandem, each excelling in its specialized domain to accelerate the entire product development pipeline.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Cursor 2.0 for machine learning projects?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can use Cursor 2.0 to write the Python code for your ML models, data pipelines, and infrastructure scripts. It excels at code generation, refactoring, and navigating ML codebases. However, it does not replace Weights & Biases' core functions. You would use Cursor to write the training script, and then use W&B's SDK within that script to log experiments, metrics, and models. They can be used together: Cursor as the intelligent code editor and W&B as the dedicated experiment tracker and model manager."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Weights & Biases useful for non-ML software development?",
      "answer": "Generally, no. Weights & Biases is highly specialized for the machine learning workflow. Its features for experiment tracking, hyperparameter sweeps, and model versioning have little direct application in general software development like building web APIs, frontends, or databases. For tracking software deployment metrics, A/B tests on user features, or system performance, you would use Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools, feature flag platforms, and observability suites instead. Its value is almost entirely concentrated within the ML model development lifecycle."
