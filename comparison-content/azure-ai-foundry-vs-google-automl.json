        "Azure AI Foundry (developer tools) is Azure AI Foundry is Microsoft's comprehensive AI development platform launched in May 2025 for building, deploying, and managing AI agents and applications. It features Agent Service for multi-agent orchestration, unified SDK combining Semantic Kernel and AutoGen, and support for Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP). Its unique value is enterprise-grade AI development with seamless Azure ecosystem integration, enabling professional developers to build sophisticated agentic applications at scale.. It's known for ai-platform, ai-agents, microsoft.",
        "Google AutoML (enterprise ai platforms) is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. Users choose it for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud."
