        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Albumentations (computer vision) is Albumentations is a high-performance, open-source Python library for image augmentation, designed specifically for deep learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of efficient, optimized image transformations (geometric, color, and pixel-level) that are crucial for training robust neural networks. Its key differentiator is its exceptional speed and flexibility, offering a unified API that works seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other frameworks, making it a de facto standard in research and production pipelines.. Users choose it for image-augmentation, data-preprocessing, pytorch-integration."
