        "ChatGPT (generative ai) is ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform developed by OpenAI that enables users to interact with a large language model (LLM) through a chat interface. Its key capabilities include generating human-like text, answering complex questions, writing and debugging code, and assisting with creative and analytical tasks across dozens of languages. It is unique for its widespread accessibility, ease of use, and its foundational role in popularizing generative AI for the general public, students, and professionals.. It's known for OpenAI, GPT-4, Conversational AI.",
        "Google Document AI (nlp) is Google Document AI is a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to automatically parse, classify, and extract structured data from scanned and digital documents. It targets businesses and developers looking to automate document-intensive workflows, offering pre-trained models for common document types and the ability to build custom processors. Its key differentiator is deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem and its use of Google's foundational AI research to deliver high-accuracy extraction with minimal configuration.. Users choose it for document-processing, intelligent-document-processing, optical-character-recognition."
