        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "OpenCV (computer vision) is OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a foundational, open-source library for real-time computer vision and machine learning. It provides over 2,500 optimized algorithms for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, motion tracking, and image stitching, with interfaces in C++, Python, and Java. Its unique value lies in its massive community adoption, extensive documentation, and robust performance across desktop, mobile (iOS/Android), and embedded systems, making it the de facto standard for both academic research and industrial applications.. Users choose it for computer-vision, image-processing, object-detection."
