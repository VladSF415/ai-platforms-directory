        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "H2O.ai (ml frameworks) is H2O.ai is an open-source, distributed machine learning and AI platform designed to make advanced analytics accessible. Its core product, H2O-3, provides scalable in-memory machine learning for Python, R, and Java, featuring a robust AutoML module for automatic model training and tuning. It uniquely targets both data scientists, by offering a familiar coding environment with high-performance algorithms (GLM, GBM, XGBoost, Deep Learning), and enterprise deployments, through its commercial H2O AI Cloud platform that operationalizes models and applications.. Users choose it for AutoML, Distributed-Computing, In-Memory-Analytics."
