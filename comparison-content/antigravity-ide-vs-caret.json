        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "caret (developer tools) is caret (Classification And Regression Training) is a comprehensive R package that provides a unified interface for training and evaluating hundreds of machine learning models. Its key capabilities include streamlined data preprocessing, model tuning, resampling, and feature selection, all within a consistent framework. It is uniquely valuable for R users in academia and industry who need a single, well-documented toolkit to compare and deploy a vast array of algorithms from different R packages without learning each one's specific syntax.. Users choose it for R, Machine Learning, Model Tuning."
