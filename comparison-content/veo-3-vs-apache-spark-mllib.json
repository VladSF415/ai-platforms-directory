        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Apache Spark MLlib (analytics bi) is Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable, distributed machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, designed to handle massive datasets across clusters. It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
