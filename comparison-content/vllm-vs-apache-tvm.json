        "vLLM is vLLM is an open-source library specifically designed for high-performance inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Its key capability is the implementation of the PagedAttention algorithm, which dramatically improves memory efficiency and throughput by managing the KV cache in non-contiguous, paged memory, similar to virtual memory in operating systems. This makes it uniquely suited for developers and organizations needing to deploy LLMs at scale with minimal hardware requirements and maximum speed.. It's known for llm-inference, model-serving, high-throughput.",
        "Apache TVM, on the other hand, is Apache TVM is an open-source deep learning compiler stack that compiles models from various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.) into optimized machine code for diverse hardware backends including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized ML accelerators. Its key capability is automatic optimization through machine learning-based auto-tuning, enabling high-performance inference across edge devices, cloud servers, and custom hardware. What makes it unique is its hardware-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that allows a single model to be deployed efficiently across dozens of different hardware targets.. Users choose it for deep-learning-compiler, model-optimization, hardware-agnostic."
