        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "JAX (ml frameworks) is JAX is a high-performance Python library for numerical computing and machine learning research that provides composable function transformations. It combines NumPy's familiar API with automatic differentiation, just-in-time (JIT) compilation via XLA, and automatic vectorization/parallelization capabilities. What makes it unique is its functional programming paradigm and ability to efficiently scale computations across GPUs and TPUs while maintaining mathematical purity.. Users choose it for Google, XLA, automatic-differentiation."
