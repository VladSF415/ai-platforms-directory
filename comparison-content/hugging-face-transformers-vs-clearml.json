        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "ClearML (ml frameworks) is ClearML is an open-source, end-to-end MLOps platform designed to streamline the entire machine learning lifecycle. It provides a unified suite for experiment tracking, orchestration of training pipelines, dataset versioning, model registry, and production deployment. Its key differentiator is its 'auto-magical' integration that automatically logs experiments, code, and artifacts with minimal code changes, making it highly popular with data scientists and ML engineers for its ease of adoption and powerful automation.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, pipeline-orchestration."
