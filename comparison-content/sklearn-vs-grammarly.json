        "Scikit-learn (ml frameworks) is Scikit-learn is a foundational, open-source Python library for machine learning that provides simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib, offering a consistent API for a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Its primary strength lies in its accessibility for beginners, robustness for production, and its role as the de facto standard for implementing classical, non-deep-learning ML workflows in the Python data science ecosystem.. It's known for Python, Classical ML, Data Science.",
        "Grammarly (generative ai) is Grammarly is an AI-powered digital writing assistant that helps users improve the correctness, clarity, and impact of their written communication. Its core capabilities include real-time grammar and spell checking, tone adjustment, plagiarism detection, and style suggestions tailored to different goals and audiences. It uniquely integrates across desktop applications, web browsers, and mobile devices to provide contextual writing feedback wherever users compose text.. Users choose it for grammar-checker, writing-assistant, proofreading."
