        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "PyTorch (ml frameworks) is PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed primarily by Meta AI that provides a flexible, Pythonic platform for building and training neural networks. Its key capability is dynamic computation graphs (eager execution), which allows for intuitive debugging and rapid prototyping, while TorchScript enables seamless conversion to static graphs for optimized production deployment. It uniquely bridges the gap between research experimentation and high-performance production, making it a favorite in academic and industrial AI labs.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, machine-learning."
