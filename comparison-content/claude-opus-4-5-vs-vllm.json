        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "vLLM (llm ops) is vLLM is an open-source library specifically designed for high-performance inference and serving of large language models (LLMs). Its key capability is the implementation of the PagedAttention algorithm, which dramatically improves memory efficiency and throughput by managing the KV cache in non-contiguous, paged memory, similar to virtual memory in operating systems. This makes it uniquely suited for developers and organizations needing to deploy LLMs at scale with minimal hardware requirements and maximum speed.. Users choose it for llm-inference, model-serving, high-throughput."
