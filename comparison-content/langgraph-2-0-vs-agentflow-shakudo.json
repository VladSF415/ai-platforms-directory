        "LangGraph 2.0 is LangGraph 2.0 is a Python library for building stateful, multi-agent applications and complex workflows, built on top of the LangChain ecosystem. It provides a graph-based programming model where nodes represent steps (LLM calls, tools, functions) and edges define the flow of control, enabling the creation of sophisticated, cyclic, and self-correcting AI agent systems. Its unique value lies in its robust, persistent state management, native support for human-in-the-loop interactions, and deep integration with the broader LangChain tooling for production-ready agent deployment.. It's known for multi-agent-systems, workflow-orchestration, stateful-llms.",
        "AgentFlow by Shakudo, on the other hand, is AgentFlow is a comprehensive platform for building, deploying, and managing autonomous AI agents at enterprise scale. It provides a visual workflow builder, pre-built agent templates, and production-grade infrastructure for running complex multi-agent systems. Its key differentiator is the ability to orchestrate multiple specialized agents working together, with built-in monitoring, version control, and compliance tools for regulated industries.. Users choose it for agent-orchestration, enterprise-ai, multi-agent."
