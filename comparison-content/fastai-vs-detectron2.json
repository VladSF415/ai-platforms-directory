      "paragraphs": [
        "Both Fast.ai and Detectron2 are completely open-source software released under the Apache License 2.0. There are no licensing fees, subscription costs, or tiered pricing models for using the core libraries. The primary cost consideration is computational: training sophisticated models, especially the large vision models in Detectron2's zoo or on large datasets with Fast.ai, requires significant GPU resources, which can incur cloud computing expenses (e.g., on AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure). Both frameworks are designed to run efficiently on consumer and professional GPUs. The ecosystem and support are community-driven, with free courses and forums for Fast.ai, and research papers/engineering blogs for Detectron2. For commercial deployment, costs are tied to inference infrastructure, not the frameworks themselves."
