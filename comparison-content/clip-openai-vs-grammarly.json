        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "Grammarly (generative ai) is Grammarly is an AI-powered digital writing assistant that helps users improve the correctness, clarity, and impact of their written communication. Its core capabilities include real-time grammar and spell checking, tone adjustment, plagiarism detection, and style suggestions tailored to different goals and audiences.
