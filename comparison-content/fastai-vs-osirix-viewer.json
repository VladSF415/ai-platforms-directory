        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "OsiriX DICOM Viewer (healthcare ai) is OsiriX is a comprehensive DICOM viewer and image processing software specifically designed for medical imaging. It provides advanced 2D, 3D, and 4D (time series) visualization, post-processing, and analysis tools for radiological images from modalities like CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT. Primarily targeted at radiologists, clinicians, and researchers, its uniqueness lies in being one of the first FDA-cleared, Mac-native DICOM workstations with extensive plugin support and a powerful, user-friendly interface for complex volumetric rendering.. Users choose it for DICOM-Viewer, Medical-Imaging, Radiology-Workstation."
