        "Google Earth Engine is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Databricks AutoML, on the other hand, is Databricks AutoML is an automated machine learning solution integrated within the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It accelerates the end-to-end ML lifecycle by automatically training, tuning, and deploying models while providing full transparency into the process (glass-box approach). It uniquely combines the scalability of Apache Spark with built-in MLflow tracking and Databricks Feature Store integration, making it a powerful tool for data teams building production-ready models.. Users choose it for automated-ml, model-training, mlops."
