        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "llama.cpp (llms) is llama.cpp is a high-performance, open-source C/C++ port of Meta's LLaMA and Llama 2 language models, designed to enable efficient inference of large language models (LLMs) directly on CPU-based hardware. Its key capabilities include advanced quantization, memory optimization, and cross-platform support, allowing models to run on commodity hardware without requiring a dedicated GPU. It uniquely targets developers and researchers seeking to deploy or experiment with LLMs in resource-constrained environments, from laptops to servers, with minimal dependencies.. Users choose it for cpu-inference, model-quantization, open-source-llm."
