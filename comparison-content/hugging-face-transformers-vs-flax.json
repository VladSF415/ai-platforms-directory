        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "Flax (ml frameworks) is Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX, designed for flexible and expressive machine learning research and production. It provides a functional, immutable approach to model definition and training, leveraging JAX's automatic differentiation and XLA compilation for speed. Its key differentiator is a clean, research-friendly API that balances flexibility for experimentation with the ability to scale to large models and datasets, making it a popular choice within the JAX ecosystem.. Users choose it for JAX, Neural-Networks, Functional-Programming."
