        "Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth is a fully managed data labeling service that helps build highly accurate training datasets for machine learning. It provides built-in workflows, access to human labelers through Amazon Mechanical Turk, third-party vendors, or your own workforce, and uses active learning to automate labeling and reduce costs. It uniquely integrates directly with the SageMaker ecosystem for end-to-end ML development and offers advanced features like automatic 3D point cloud labeling and adjustment workflows.. It's known for aws, data-labeling, training-data.",
        "CTGAN, on the other hand, is CTGAN (Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network) is an open-source Python library for generating high-quality synthetic tabular data that mimics the statistical properties and complex relationships of real datasets. It is specifically designed to handle mixed data types (continuous and discrete columns) and skewed distributions, making it uniquely capable of preserving privacy while enabling data augmentation and sharing. Its primary audience includes data scientists, researchers, and developers working in environments with sensitive or limited data.. Users choose it for synthetic-data, generative-adversarial-networks, tabular-data."
