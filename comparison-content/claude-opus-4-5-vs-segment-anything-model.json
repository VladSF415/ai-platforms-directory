        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
