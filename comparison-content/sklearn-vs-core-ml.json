        "Core ML (ml frameworks) is Core ML is Apple's proprietary machine learning framework designed to enable developers to integrate trained machine learning models directly into applications running on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Its key capability is performing fast, on-device inference, leveraging Apple's hardware accelerators (Neural Engine, GPU, CPU) for optimal performance while ensuring user data privacy by keeping processing local. It is unique for its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, providing a standardized format (.mlmodel) and tools that simplify the deployment of models from popular training frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.. Users choose it for apple, on-device-ai, ios-development."
