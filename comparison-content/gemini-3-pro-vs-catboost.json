        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "CatBoost (analytics bi) is CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, specifically engineered for high performance on datasets with categorical features. Its key capabilities include advanced handling of categorical data without extensive preprocessing, symmetric tree structures for faster inference, and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting. It uniquely targets data scientists and machine learning engineers who need robust, out-of-the-box performance on heterogeneous data, particularly in tabular prediction tasks where categorical variables are prevalent.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, categorical-data, tabular-data."
