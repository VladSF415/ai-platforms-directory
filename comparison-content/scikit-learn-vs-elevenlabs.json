      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models are completely divergent, reflecting their different natures. Scikit-learn is entirely free and open-source under a BSD license. There are no usage limits, tiers, or costs associated with the library itself. Users only need a Python environment. However, costs can arise from computational resources (e.g., cloud VMs for heavy training) and developer time.\n\nElevenLabs operates on a freemium, usage-based subscription model. A free tier offers limited monthly character generation and basic features. Paid plans (Starting, Creator, Pro, Scale) increase monthly character limits, provide access to more voices and advanced features like voice cloning, and offer higher-quality audio generation. Enterprise plans offer custom pricing, dedicated infrastructure, and enhanced security. Costs scale directly with audio output volume, making it crucial to estimate usage needs for budgeting."
