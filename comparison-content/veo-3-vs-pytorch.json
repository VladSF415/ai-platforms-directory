        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "PyTorch (ml frameworks) is PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed primarily by Meta AI that provides a flexible, Pythonic platform for building and training neural networks. Its key capability is dynamic computation graphs (eager execution), which allows for intuitive debugging and rapid prototyping, while TorchScript enables seamless conversion to static graphs for optimized production deployment. It uniquely bridges the gap between research experimentation and high-performance production, making it a favorite in academic and industrial AI labs.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, machine-learning."
