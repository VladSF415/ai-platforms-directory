        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Triton Inference Server (ml frameworks) is NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is an open-source, high-performance inference serving software designed to deploy, run, and scale AI models from any framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT) on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure. It uniquely enables production AI workloads by providing features like dynamic batching, concurrent model execution, and model ensembles to maximize throughput and utilization. Its primary audience is ML engineers and DevOps teams building scalable, multi-framework inference pipelines in data centers, cloud, or edge environments.. Users choose it for NVIDIA, Model Serving, Inference Optimization."
