        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "DVC (Data Version Control) (ml frameworks) is DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system specifically designed for machine learning projects, enabling Git-like operations for large datasets, models, and experiments. It provides data versioning, experiment tracking, and reproducible pipeline management while maintaining seamless integration with Git for code. What makes it unique is its ability to handle large files and datasets efficiently while keeping the familiar Git workflow, making ML projects as reproducible and collaborative as software development.. Users choose it for mlops, data-versioning, experiment-tracking."
