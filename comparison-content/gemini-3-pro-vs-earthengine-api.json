        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. Users choose it for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing."
