        "Google AutoML is Google Cloud AutoML is a suite of managed services that enables developers and businesses with limited machine learning expertise to build and deploy high-quality custom models for vision, language, translation, and tabular data. It automates complex tasks like neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing development time. Its key differentiator is providing Google-grade model quality through a no-code GUI and a full API, making advanced AI accessible without deep ML knowledge.. It's known for automated-ml, custom-model-training, google-cloud.",
        "SentinelOne, on the other hand, is SentinelOne is a leading AI-powered cybersecurity platform that delivers autonomous, real-time endpoint protection, cloud workload security, and identity threat detection. Its core capability is the Singularity Platform, which uses a static AI engine and behavioral models to prevent, detect, and automatically remediate threats across endpoints, containers, and cloud workloads. It is uniquely positioned by its fully autonomous 'Storyline' technology that correlates events into a single, actionable thread for rapid response, making it a top choice for enterprises seeking to consolidate security tools and reduce mean time to response (MTTR).. Users choose it for endpoint-detection-response, extended-detection-response, cloud-workload-protection-platform."
