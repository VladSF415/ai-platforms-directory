        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Apache TVM (llm ops) is Apache TVM is an open-source deep learning compiler stack that compiles models from various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc.) into optimized machine code for diverse hardware backends including CPUs, GPUs, and specialized ML accelerators. Its key capability is automatic optimization through machine learning-based auto-tuning, enabling high-performance inference across edge devices, cloud servers, and custom hardware. What makes it unique is its hardware-agnostic intermediate representation (IR) that allows a single model to be deployed efficiently across dozens of different hardware targets.. Users choose it for deep-learning-compiler, model-optimization, hardware-agnostic."
