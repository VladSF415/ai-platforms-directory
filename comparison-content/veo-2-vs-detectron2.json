        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Detectron2 (ml frameworks) is Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's (FAIR) open-source, PyTorch-based library for state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and keypoint detection. It is designed for researchers and engineers who need a flexible, high-performance platform to train, evaluate, and deploy custom models, offering a modular design that allows for easy extension and experimentation with new architectures. Its unique value lies in its production-ready codebase, extensive model zoo with pre-trained models, and its role as a foundational research platform behind many cutting-edge publications in computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, pytorch."
