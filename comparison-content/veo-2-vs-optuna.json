        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Optuna (ml frameworks) is Optuna is an open-source, automatic hyperparameter optimization framework designed specifically for machine learning. Its key capabilities include defining search spaces with a dynamic, Pythonic API and employing efficient sampling and pruning algorithms to accelerate the tuning process. It is unique for its 'define-by-run' paradigm, which allows for dynamic construction of parameter spaces, making it highly flexible and favored by researchers and engineers for complex optimization tasks.. Users choose it for hyperparameter-optimization, automl, bayesian-optimization."
