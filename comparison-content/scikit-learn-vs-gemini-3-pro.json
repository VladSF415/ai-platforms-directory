      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models are fundamentally different, reflecting their core architectures. Scikit-learn is completely free and open-source (BSD license). There are no usage fees, API costs, or tiered plans. The only associated costs are the computational resources required to run your Python code and the time of your developers. This makes it exceptionally cost-effective for prototyping, research, and deployment at any scale, with no vendor lock-in.\n\nGemini 3 Pro operates on a freemium model. Google offers a limited free tier for the Gemini API, but for serious development, production use, or accessing the full 1M context window and advanced features, you move to a paid, usage-based pricing structure. Costs are typically calculated per million tokens of input and output, with potential additional costs for video processing. This can become a significant operational expense for high-volume applications but provides access to cutting-edge AI capabilities without the need for training your own multi-trillion parameter model."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can Gemini 3 Pro replace Scikit-learn for data science tasks?",
      "answer": "No, not directly. Gemini 3 Pro is not designed to be a drop-in replacement for a classical ML library. While it can write Scikit-learn code and explain statistical concepts, it cannot itself perform the core functions of Scikit-learn: fitting a Random Forest model to your specific dataset, running a GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, or creating a preprocessing pipeline. Scikit-learn is for building and optimizing models; Gemini 3 Pro is for reasoning, generating, and understanding. They operate at different levels of abstraction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it possible to use Scikit-learn and Gemini 3 Pro together?",
      "answer": "Absolutely, and this is a powerful combination. A common pattern in 2025 is using Gemini 3 Pro for upstream and downstream tasks in a Scikit-learn workflow. For example: Use Gemini to clean and label unstructured text data, which is then transformed into features for a Scikit-learn model. Or, after a Scikit-learn model makes a prediction (e.g., \"customer churn risk: 85%\"), use Gemini to generate a personalized, natural language explanation or email for the customer. Gemini can also be used to help debug or optimize Scikit-learn code. This synergy leverages the strengths of both tools."
