        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "AutoGen (workflow automation) is AutoGen is an open-source framework from Microsoft Research for building and orchestrating multi-agent AI systems. It enables developers to create, manage, and coordinate multiple conversational AI agents—each with specialized roles, capabilities, and tools—to collaboratively solve complex tasks through structured dialogue. Its unique value lies in its flexible, code-centric approach to agent definition and its seamless integration with human oversight, making it a powerful tool for automating intricate workflows that require reasoning, tool use, and iterative problem-solving.. Users choose it for multi-agent-systems, conversational-ai, workflow-automation."
