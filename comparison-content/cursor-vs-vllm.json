        "Cursor (code ai) is Cursor is an AI-first code editor designed to deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the software development workflow. It is built on a modified version of VS Code and features a powerful AI agent that can understand codebase context, generate and edit code across multiple files, and answer complex questions about a project. It uniquely positions itself as a true 'pair programmer' by allowing developers to chat with, command, and collaborate with AI directly within their editor, moving beyond simple autocomplete to a more interactive and contextual coding experience.. It's known for ai-code-editor, pair-programming, code-generation.",
