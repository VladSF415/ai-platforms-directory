        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "PEFT (ml frameworks) is PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a Hugging Face library that enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, drastically reducing computational and memory costs. It provides state-of-the-art methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and Adapters, making it uniquely suited for researchers and practitioners who need to customize models for specific tasks without full retraining. Its seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the go-to tool for parameter-efficient transfer learning.. Users choose it for parameter-efficient-fine-tuning, lora, adapters."
