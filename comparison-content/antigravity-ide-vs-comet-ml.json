        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Comet ML (llm ops) is Comet ML is an end-to-end MLOps platform designed to manage, visualize, and optimize the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its key capabilities include experiment tracking, model registry, production monitoring, and specialized tools for evaluating and comparing Large Language Models (LLMs). It is unique for its deep integration with LLM workflows, offering side-by-side comparison of prompts, models, and chains, and its ability to track and version datasets alongside models, making it a central hub for AI teams.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, model-registry."
