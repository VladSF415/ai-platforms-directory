        "Runware (developer tools) is Runware is a developer-focused API platform for real-time generation of images, videos, and audio powered by advanced AI models. Founded in 2023 and raising $50M in Series A funding in December 2025, it has powered over 10 billion creations for 200,000+ developers. Its unique value is providing a unified API to access multiple AI models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, video generators) with sub-second latency and enterprise-grade reliability.. It's known for api, image-generation, video-generation.",
        "Google Document AI (nlp) is Google Document AI is a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to automatically parse, classify, and extract structured data from scanned and digital documents. It targets businesses and developers looking to automate document-intensive workflows, offering pre-trained models for common document types and the ability to build custom processors. Its key differentiator is deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem and its use of Google's foundational AI research to deliver high-accuracy extraction with minimal configuration.. Users choose it for document-processing, intelligent-document-processing, optical-character-recognition."
