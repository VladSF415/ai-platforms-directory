      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for SAM and Cursor 2.0 reflect their different target audiences and philosophies. SAM is completely open-source (Apache 2.0). There are no usage fees, subscriptions, or tiers. Users can download the model weights, run it locally, or integrate it into commercial products without any direct cost from Meta. The primary 'cost' is computational, requiring GPU resources for inference, especially for the larger model variants. This makes SAM exceptionally accessible for academia, indie developers, and companies of all sizes.\n\nCursor 2.0 employs a freemium model. A free tier is available with limited usage of its advanced AI features, suitable for individual developers or light use.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is SAM's 'text prompt' feature as effective as using points or boxes?",
      "answer": "In its current state, SAM's text-to-mask capability is generally considered less robust and precise than using visual prompts like points or bounding boxes. The model was primarily trained and optimized for visual prompts. Using a point or a box provides a much clearer, unambiguous spatial signal for the model to generate a mask. Text prompts can work for obvious objects (e.g., 'cat', 'car'), but for finer-grained or ambiguous segmentation, visual prompts are the recommended and more reliable method. For advanced text-based segmentation, models specifically designed for that task might be more suitable."
