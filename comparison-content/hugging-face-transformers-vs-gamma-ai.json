        "Hugging Face Transformers (ml frameworks) is Hugging Face Transformers is an open-source Python library that provides state-of-the-art implementations of transformer-based models for natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, audio, and multimodal tasks. It enables developers and researchers to easily download, fine-tune, and deploy thousands of pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub. Its unique value lies in its unified, framework-agnostic API (supporting PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX), its massive community-driven model repository, and its extensive tooling for the entire model lifecycle.. It's known for transformers, nlp, pre-trained-models.",
        "Gamma AI (productivity) is Gamma is an AI-powered presentation platform that creates professional slides, documents, and webpages from simple text prompts or outlines. Launched in 2023 and achieving a $2.1B valuation in November 2026, it uses AI to handle design, formatting, and visual layouts automatically.
