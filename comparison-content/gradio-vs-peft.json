        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. It's known for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool.",
        "PEFT (ml frameworks) is PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a Hugging Face library that enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, drastically reducing computational and memory costs. It provides state-of-the-art methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and Adapters, making it uniquely suited for researchers and practitioners who need to customize models for specific tasks without full retraining. Its seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the go-to tool for parameter-efficient transfer learning.. Users choose it for parameter-efficient-fine-tuning, lora, adapters."
