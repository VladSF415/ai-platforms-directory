        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Streamlit (ml frameworks) is Streamlit is an open-source Python framework that enables data scientists and machine learning engineers to transform data scripts into shareable web applications in minutes, without requiring front-end web development skills. Its key capability is turning Python scripts into interactive apps with widgets, visualizations, and data caching through a simple declarative API. What makes it unique is its rapid development cycle with hot-reloading, a growing ecosystem of community-built components, and seamless integration with popular data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.. Users choose it for python-framework, data-apps, prototyping."
