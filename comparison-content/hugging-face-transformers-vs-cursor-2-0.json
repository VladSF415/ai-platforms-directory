      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for these tools reflect their different target users and value propositions. Hugging Face Transformers is completely open-source and free to use. The core `transformers` library, along with `datasets` and `evaluate`, are licensed under Apache 2.0. The Hugging Face Hub offers free access to host and download public models, datasets, and demos. For enterprise teams, Hugging Face offers paid plans (Hub Pro, Enterprise Hub) that provide private repositories, enhanced security, dedicated inference endpoints, and enterprise support. This freemium model makes the core technology accessible to all while monetizing advanced collaboration and deployment features.\n\nCursor 2.0 operates on a freemium model for the IDE itself. A free tier is available with limited features, typically capped usage of the AI agent, or access to less powerful underlying models. The paid 'Pro' subscription unlocks the full potential: unlimited use of the autonomous edit mode, access to the latest and most capable LLMs (GPT-5, Claude 3.7), and priority support. Users also incur costs based on the usage of the underlying LLM APIs from OpenAI or Anthropic, which are billed separately through Cursor. For a professional developer, the subscription is an investment in productivity, offsetting its cost through dramatically reduced development time."
