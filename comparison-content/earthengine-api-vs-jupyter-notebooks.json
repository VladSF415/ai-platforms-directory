        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Jupyter Notebooks (ml frameworks) is Jupyter Notebooks is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its key capability is interactive, exploratory computing, enabling users to run code in multiple programming languages (like Python, R, Julia) in a cell-based environment and see results immediately. It is uniquely powerful for data science, scientific research, and education due to its blend of executable code, rich media output, and explanatory text in a single, shareable document.. Users choose it for open-source, interactive-computing, data-science."
