        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Comet ML (llm ops) is Comet ML is an end-to-end MLOps platform designed to manage, visualize, and optimize the entire machine learning lifecycle. Its key capabilities include experiment tracking, model registry, production monitoring, and specialized tools for evaluating and comparing Large Language Models (LLMs). It is unique for its deep integration with LLM workflows, offering side-by-side comparison of prompts, models, and chains, and its ability to track and version datasets alongside models, making it a central hub for AI teams.. Users choose it for mlops, experiment-tracking, model-registry."
