        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Ray (ml frameworks) is Ray is an open-source, unified compute framework that enables developers to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a large cluster with minimal code changes. Its core provides low-level distributed computing primitives (tasks, actors, objects) and high-level libraries for machine learning (Ray Train, Tune, Serve, RLlib), making it uniquely suited for building end-to-end, distributed AI applications. It is primarily targeted at ML engineers, researchers, and data scientists who need to parallelize workloads, manage complex compute clusters, and productionize AI models efficiently.. Users choose it for distributed-computing, parallel-processing, ml-ops."
