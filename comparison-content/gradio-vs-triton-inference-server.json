        "Gradio (ml frameworks) is Gradio is an open-source Python library that enables developers to quickly create and share user-friendly web interfaces for machine learning models, data science workflows, and Python scripts. Its key capability is transforming any Python function into an interactive web app with just a few lines of code, complete with input components (like sliders, textboxes, and image uploaders) and real-time output display. It uniquely targets ML practitioners, researchers, and educators by making model deployment and sharing exceptionally fast and accessible, without requiring front-end web development expertise.. It's known for ui-builder, model-deployment, prototyping-tool.",
        "Triton Inference Server (ml frameworks) is NVIDIA Triton Inference Server is an open-source, high-performance inference serving software designed to deploy, run, and scale AI models from any framework (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, TensorRT) on any GPU or CPU-based infrastructure. It uniquely enables production AI workloads by providing features like dynamic batching, concurrent model execution, and model ensembles to maximize throughput and utilization. Its primary audience is ML engineers and DevOps teams building scalable, multi-framework inference pipelines in data centers, cloud, or edge environments.. Users choose it for NVIDIA, Model Serving, Inference Optimization."
