      "paragraphs": [
        "Both AutoGen and Polars are completely open-source projects with permissive licenses, making them free to use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. This eliminates direct licensing costs as a differentiator between the two frameworks. However, the operational costs differ significantly based on their underlying architectures and typical usage patterns. AutoGen's primary cost driver is its dependency on external LLM APIs (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Azure OpenAI) for agent reasoning. Running complex multi-agent workflows can generate substantial API costs, especially for lengthy conversations or frequent tool calls. Additionally, hosting AutoGen applications may require more computational resources to manage agent state and conversation orchestration. Polars, in contrast, has minimal operational costs beyond standard compute infrastructure. Its performance optimizations can actually reduce costs by completing data processing tasks faster, requiring less cloud compute time. The main cost consideration for Polars is developer expertise—its Rust-based architecture and different API patterns compared to pandas may require additional learning investment. Both projects benefit from active community support, though enterprise support options may vary based on commercial backing and ecosystem maturity."
