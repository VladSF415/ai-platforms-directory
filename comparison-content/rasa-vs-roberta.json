        "Rasa is Rasa is an open-source framework for building production-ready, contextual AI assistants and chatbots. Its core capabilities include highly customizable natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management, enabling developers to create assistants that handle complex, multi-turn conversations. It is uniquely designed for developers and enterprises that require full data control, the ability to run on-premises or in private clouds, and deep customization beyond simple rule-based bots.. It's known for conversational-ai, chatbot-framework, nlp-framework.",
        "RoBERTa, on the other hand, is RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) is a transformer-based language model for natural language processing (NLP). It is a replication study and optimization of Google's BERT architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results on key NLP benchmarks like GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD by removing the next-sentence prediction objective and training with significantly more data and larger batch sizes. Its key capability is providing highly accurate text representations for downstream tasks like classification, question answering, and sentiment analysis, primarily targeting AI researchers and engineers building advanced NLP systems.. Users choose it for transformer-model, language-model, text-classification."
