        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "3DF Zephyr (computer vision) is 3DF Zephyr is a professional-grade photogrammetry software that automatically reconstructs highly detailed 3D models and scenes from standard photographs. It is designed for professionals in fields like cultural heritage, surveying, and visual effects, offering comprehensive workflows from point cloud generation to textured mesh creation and measurements. Its key differentiator is a powerful, user-friendly pipeline that balances advanced automation with extensive manual editing and export tools, all accelerated by multi-GPU support.. Users choose it for photogrammetry, 3d-reconstruction, point-cloud."
