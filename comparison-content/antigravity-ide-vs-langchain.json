      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Antigravity IDE is completely free during its preview period, with no announced pricing model for its eventual full release. This makes it exceptionally accessible for individual developers, students, and small teams looking to experiment with multi-agent AI coding assistance. The free tier includes access to all features: multi-agent orchestration, integrated Chrome automation, support for premium AI models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude 4.5, GPT-o3), and collaborative editing. LangChain follows an open-source model with its core framework available under the MIT license, completely free for commercial and personal use. However, its companion platforms—LangSmith for debugging/monitoring and LangServe for deployment—offer both free tiers with limitations and paid enterprise plans. The true cost of LangChain often comes from the AI model APIs it connects to (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and potential infrastructure costs for running vector databases and other components."
