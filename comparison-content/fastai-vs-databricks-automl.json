        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Databricks AutoML (ml frameworks) is Databricks AutoML is an automated machine learning solution integrated within the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. It accelerates the end-to-end ML lifecycle by automatically training, tuning, and deploying models while providing full transparency into the process (glass-box approach). It uniquely combines the scalability of Apache Spark with built-in MLflow tracking and Databricks Feature Store integration, making it a powerful tool for data teams building production-ready models.. Users choose it for automated-ml, model-training, mlops."
