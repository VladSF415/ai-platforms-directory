        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Core ML (ml frameworks) is Core ML is Apple's proprietary machine learning framework designed to enable developers to integrate trained machine learning models directly into applications running on iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Its key capability is performing fast, on-device inference, leveraging Apple's hardware accelerators (Neural Engine, GPU, CPU) for optimal performance while ensuring user data privacy by keeping processing local. It is unique for its seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, providing a standardized format (.mlmodel) and tools that simplify the deployment of models from popular training frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.. Users choose it for apple, on-device-ai, ios-development."
