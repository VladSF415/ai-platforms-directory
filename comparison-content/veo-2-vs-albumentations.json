        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Albumentations (computer vision) is Albumentations is a high-performance, open-source Python library for image augmentation, designed specifically for deep learning and computer vision tasks. It provides a vast collection of efficient, optimized image transformations (geometric, color, and pixel-level) that are crucial for training robust neural networks. Its key differentiator is its exceptional speed and flexibility, offering a unified API that works seamlessly with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and other frameworks, making it a de facto standard in research and production pipelines.. Users choose it for image-augmentation, data-preprocessing, pytorch-integration."
