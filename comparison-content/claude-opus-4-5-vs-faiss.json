        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2025 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Faiss (ml frameworks) is Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a specialized open-source library developed by Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is designed to handle massive, high-dimensional vector datasets, enabling rapid nearest neighbor searches crucial for applications like recommendation systems and semantic search. Its key differentiator is its highly optimized C++ core with GPU support, offering state-of-the-art performance and scalability that outperforms naive implementations, making it a foundational tool for vector databases and AI-powered retrieval.. Users choose it for vector-search, nearest-neighbor-search, high-performance-computing."
