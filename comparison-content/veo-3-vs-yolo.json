        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "YOLO (You Only Look Once) (computer vision) is YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a groundbreaking real-time object detection system that applies a single convolutional neural network to the entire image, simultaneously predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in one forward pass. Its key capability is performing detection at high frame rates (e.g., 45-155 FPS depending on version) while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it uniquely efficient compared to traditional multi-stage detectors. It primarily targets developers and researchers in computer vision who need fast, deployable object detection for applications like video analysis, robotics, and autonomous systems.. Users choose it for object-detection, real-time-inference, convolutional-neural-networks."
