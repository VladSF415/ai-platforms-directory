        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
