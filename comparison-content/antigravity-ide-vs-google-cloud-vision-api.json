        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2026 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Google Cloud Vision API (computer vision) is Google Cloud Vision API is a fully managed, pre-trained machine learning service that enables developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into applications without requiring deep ML expertise. Its key capabilities include detecting objects, faces, landmarks, logos, and text (OCR) within images, as well as filtering explicit content and generating image metadata. It uniquely leverages Google's massive-scale, proprietary datasets and research to deliver high-accuracy, production-ready models accessible via a simple REST API, making it a top choice for enterprises and developers needing reliable, scalable computer vision.. Users choose it for image-analysis, optical-character-recognition, object-detection."
