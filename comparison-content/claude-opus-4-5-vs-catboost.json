        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "CatBoost (analytics bi) is CatBoost is an open-source gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, specifically engineered for high performance on datasets with categorical features. Its key capabilities include advanced handling of categorical data without extensive preprocessing, symmetric tree structures for faster inference, and ordered boosting to reduce overfitting. It uniquely targets data scientists and machine learning engineers who need robust, out-of-the-box performance on heterogeneous data, particularly in tabular prediction tasks where categorical variables are prevalent.. Users choose it for gradient-boosting, categorical-data, tabular-data."
