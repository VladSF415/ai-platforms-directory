        "Antigravity (developer tools) is Antigravity is a revolutionary multi-agent AI code editor that debuted at #1 in December 2025 developer rankings. Completely free during preview, it features unique multi-agent orchestration where multiple AI agents collaborate on complex coding tasks, integrated Chrome browser automation for testing, and support for the latest models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.5). Its key differentiator is multi-agent collaboration—a capability no competitor offers—enabling it to tackle complex projects autonomously.. It's known for code-editor, ai-agents, multi-agent.",
        "Google Document AI (nlp) is Google Document AI is a cloud-based platform that uses machine learning to automatically parse, classify, and extract structured data from scanned and digital documents. It targets businesses and developers looking to automate document-intensive workflows, offering pre-trained models for common document types and the ability to build custom processors. Its key differentiator is deep integration with the Google Cloud ecosystem and its use of Google's foundational AI research to deliver high-accuracy extraction with minimal configuration.. Users choose it for document-processing, intelligent-document-processing, optical-character-recognition."
