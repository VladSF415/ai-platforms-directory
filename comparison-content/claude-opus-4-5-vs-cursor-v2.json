      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "Claude Opus 4.5 operates on a paid API model, where users are charged based on token usage (input and output). This can become costly for heavy usage, especially with its extended thinking mode for complex reasoning tasks. Pricing is transparent but scales directly with consumption, making it a variable operational cost that teams must manage. There is no freemium tier for Opus 4.5 itself, though Anthropic may offer other models at lower price points.\n\nCursor v2 employs a freemium model. A free tier is available with limited features or usage caps, providing access to its core AI editor functionality, likely with constraints on the number of queries or the power of the underlying LLM. Paid subscription plans unlock full capabilities, including access to the most powerful integrated LLMs (like Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5), unlimited autonomous commands, and advanced project-wide features. This model offers predictable monthly/annual costs for professionals and teams, bundling both the editor and AI compute into a single subscription."
