        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Google Speech-to-Text (audio ai) is Google Speech-to-Text is a cloud-based AI service that converts audio to text using Google's state-of-the-art Chirp foundation model. It enables developers and businesses to add accurate speech recognition to applications, supporting real-time streaming, batch processing, and custom model adaptation. Its key differentiators are industry-leading accuracy powered by Google's deep research, support for over 125 languages and variants, and seamless integration within the Google Cloud ecosystem.. Users choose it for speech-recognition, audio-transcription, google-cloud."
