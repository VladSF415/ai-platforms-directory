        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Ray (ml frameworks) is Ray is an open-source, unified compute framework that enables developers to scale Python and AI applications from a laptop to a large cluster with minimal code changes. Its core provides low-level distributed computing primitives (tasks, actors, objects) and high-level libraries for machine learning (Ray Train, Tune, Serve, RLlib), making it uniquely suited for building end-to-end, distributed AI applications. It is primarily targeted at ML engineers, researchers, and data scientists who need to parallelize workloads, manage complex compute clusters, and productionize AI models efficiently.. Users choose it for distributed-computing, parallel-processing, ml-ops."
