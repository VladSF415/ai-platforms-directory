        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "CVAT (developer tools) is CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) is an open-source, web-based platform designed for the efficient annotation of images and videos for computer vision projects. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for 2D and 3D data labeling, supports team collaboration, and is built with extensibility in mind through its API and SDK. What makes it unique is its powerful interpolation for video annotation, native support for complex tasks like point clouds and 3D cuboids, and its origin as an Intel project, ensuring robust performance and active development for industrial-scale AI data pipelines.. Users choose it for data-labeling, video-annotation, point-cloud."
