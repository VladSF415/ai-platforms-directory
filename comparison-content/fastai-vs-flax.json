        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "Flax (ml frameworks) is Flax is a high-performance neural network library built on top of JAX, designed for flexible and expressive machine learning research and production. It provides a functional, immutable approach to model definition and training, leveraging JAX's automatic differentiation and XLA compilation for speed. Its key differentiator is a clean, research-friendly API that balances flexibility for experimentation with the ability to scale to large models and datasets, making it a popular choice within the JAX ecosystem.. Users choose it for JAX, Neural-Networks, Functional-Programming."
