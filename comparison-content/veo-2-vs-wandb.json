        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "Weights & Biases (ml frameworks) is Weights & Biases (W&B) is an MLOps platform that helps developers and teams track, visualize, and manage the machine learning lifecycle. Its core capabilities include experiment tracking, dataset and model versioning, hyperparameter optimization, and collaborative dashboards for model evaluation. It is unique for its highly intuitive, developer-first interface, deep integration with popular ML frameworks, and powerful tools for reproducibility and collaboration that scale from individual researchers to large enterprise teams.. Users choose it for experiment-tracking, model-registry, hyperparameter-optimization."
