        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Apache Spark MLlib (analytics bi) is Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable, distributed machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, designed to handle massive datasets across clusters. It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
