        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2025 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Detectron2 (ml frameworks) is Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's (FAIR) open-source, PyTorch-based library for state-of-the-art computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and keypoint detection. It is designed for researchers and engineers who need a flexible, high-performance platform to train, evaluate, and deploy custom models, offering a modular design that allows for easy extension and experimentation with new architectures. Its unique value lies in its production-ready codebase, extensive model zoo with pre-trained models, and its role as a foundational research platform behind many cutting-edge publications in computer vision.. Users choose it for object-detection, instance-segmentation, pytorch."
