        "Google Earth Engine (analytics bi) is Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based planetary-scale geospatial analysis platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful computational capabilities. It enables users, primarily scientists and developers, to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface by analyzing decades of historical data. Its unique value lies in providing free access to this massive, constantly updated data archive and the parallel processing power needed to analyze it at a global scale, which would be otherwise impossible for individual researchers.. It's known for geospatial-analysis, satellite-imagery, remote-sensing.",
        "Google Cloud Natural Language (nlp) is Google Cloud Natural Language is a managed AI service that uses Google's pre-trained machine learning models to analyze and extract insights from unstructured text. Its key capabilities include entity recognition, sentiment analysis, content classification, and syntax parsing, supporting multiple languages. It is designed for developers, data scientists, and businesses needing to integrate advanced NLP into applications without building models from scratch, and is unique for its deep integration with Google's search and knowledge graph data.. Users choose it for google-cloud, sentiment-analysis, entity-extraction."
