        "Both Fast.ai and Flux.1 are fundamentally open-source, but their licensing and commercial models differ significantly. Fast.ai is completely free and open-source under the Apache License 2.0. There are no tiers, paid plans, or usage restrictions. Users can deploy models built with Fast.ai commercially without any licensing fees. Flux.1 employs a dual-license model. The 'Flux.1 dev' model is released under a non-commercial, open-weight license, allowing free use for research, personal projects, and experimentation. For commercial applications, businesses must license the 'Flux.1 pro' model. This typically involves a licensing fee paid to Black Forest Labs, the terms of which would be negotiated based on scale and use case. Therefore, while the core technology is open, commercial image generation with Flux.1 carries a cost."

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can I use Fast.ai to create an image generator like Flux.1?",
      "answer": "No, not directly. Fast.ai is a framework for training discriminative models (e.g., classifiers, predictors) on your data. While you could theoretically use it to implement and train a diffusion model from research papers, this would require extensive, low-level coding and expertise, defeating Fast.ai's purpose of simplicity. Flux.1 is a pre-trained, production-ready generative model specifically architected for text-to-image synthesis. Building something of comparable quality from scratch is a massive, resource-intensive research undertaking. Fast.ai is for applying AI to your data; Flux.1 *is* the applied AI model for generation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the Flux.1 'dev' model completely free to use for any project?",
      "answer": "No, the Flux.1 'dev' model is released under a non-commercial license. This means you are free to use it for academic research, personal projects, experimentation, and testing. However, you cannot use the outputs (the generated images) for commercial purposes, such as selling them, using them in a product you sell, or in marketing for a business. For any commercial application, you must obtain a license for the Flux.1 'pro' model from Black Forest Labs. Always review the specific license terms for the exact version you are using."
