        "Google Veo 2 (video generation) is Google Veo 2 is a state-of-the-art generative AI model designed to create high-quality, realistic videos from text, image, or video prompts. It excels at producing 1080p resolution videos with fine-grained control over cinematic styles, advanced physics simulation, and temporal consistency for coherent motion. Primarily targeting professional creators and filmmakers, it distinguishes itself through deep integration with Google's ecosystem and research in scalable video generation.. It's known for video-generation, generative-ai, google-deepmind.",
        "PEFT (ml frameworks) is PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) is a Hugging Face library that enables efficient adaptation of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, drastically reducing computational and memory costs. It provides state-of-the-art methods like LoRA, Prefix Tuning, and Adapters, making it uniquely suited for researchers and practitioners who need to customize models for specific tasks without full retraining. Its seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the go-to tool for parameter-efficient transfer learning.. Users choose it for parameter-efficient-fine-tuning, lora, adapters."
