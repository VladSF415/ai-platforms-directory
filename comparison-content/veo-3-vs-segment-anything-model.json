        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2026 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2026, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "Segment Anything Model (SAM) (computer vision) is The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a foundational AI model developed by Meta AI that performs promptable image segmentation, capable of generating high-quality object masks from various input prompts like points, boxes, or text. Its key capability is zero-shot generalization, allowing it to segment objects it was never explicitly trained on, powered by training on the massive SA-1B dataset of over 1 billion masks. This makes it uniquely versatile for researchers and developers needing a robust, general-purpose segmentation tool without task-specific fine-tuning.. Users choose it for image-segmentation, foundation-model, zero-shot-learning."
