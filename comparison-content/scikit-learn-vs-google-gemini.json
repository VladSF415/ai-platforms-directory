        "Google Gemini (llms) is Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models (LLMs) designed to process and reason across text, code, images, audio, and video. It is engineered for advanced reasoning, planning, and complex instruction-following, making it a direct competitor to models like GPT-4. Its unique integration with the Google ecosystem (Search, Workspace, Android) and its native multimodality from the ground up are key differentiators.. Users choose it for multimodal-ai, large-language-model, google-ai."
