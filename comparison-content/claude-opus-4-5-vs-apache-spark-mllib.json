        "Claude Opus 4.5 (llms) is Claude Opus 4.5 is Anthropic's most advanced AI model, launched in November 2026 as the world's best coding model. It features sustained performance on complex, long-running tasks and agent workflows, with two operational modes: near-instant responses for quick queries and extended thinking for deep reasoning on complex problems. Its unique value is exceptional coding capabilities, advanced agentic workflows, and industry-leading safety features with constitutional AI.. It's known for llm, coding, ai-agents.",
        "Apache Spark MLlib (analytics bi) is Apache Spark MLlib is a scalable, distributed machine learning library built on top of Apache Spark, designed to handle massive datasets across clusters. It provides a comprehensive suite of high-quality algorithms for common ML tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering, along with utilities for feature transformation, model evaluation, and pipeline construction. Its key differentiator is its tight integration with the Spark engine, enabling it to leverage in-memory computing and fault-tolerant data structures (RDDs, DataFrames) for iterative ML workloads that are orders of magnitude faster than traditional disk-based systems like Hadoop MapReduce.. Users choose it for distributed-ml, scalable-algorithms, spark-ecosystem."
