        "AWS SageMaker Autopilot is Amazon SageMaker Autopilot is an automated machine learning (AutoML) service that automatically builds, trains, and tunes machine learning models based on your data, while providing full visibility into the underlying processes and candidate models. It is designed for data scientists and developers who want to accelerate model creation without sacrificing control or transparency. Its key differentiator is the combination of full automation with complete visibility into the generated notebooks, feature engineering steps, and model leaderboard, allowing for expert review and customization.. It's known for automl, aws, machine-learning.",
        "Dataiku, on the other hand, is Dataiku is an end-to-end enterprise AI and data science platform that enables organizations to design, deploy, and govern data and AI projects at scale. It provides a unified collaborative environment where data scientists, analysts, and engineers can work together using visual tools, code notebooks, and automated machine learning. What sets Dataiku apart is its strong focus on enterprise governance, operationalization, and the ability to bridge the gap between prototyping and production deployment across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.. Users choose it for data-science-platform, mlops, collaborative-ai."
