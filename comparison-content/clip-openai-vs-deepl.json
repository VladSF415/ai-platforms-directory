  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can CLIP be used for translation like DeepL?",
      "answer": "No, CLIP cannot be used for translation in the way DeepL functions. CLIP is specifically designed for understanding the relationship between images and text descriptions—it learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. While it processes text to create embeddings that can be compared with image embeddings, it doesn't translate between languages. DeepL, in contrast, is specialized for neural machine translation between different human languages. These are fundamentally different capabilities: CLIP connects visual and textual domains within a single language, while DeepL connects different languages within the textual domain."
