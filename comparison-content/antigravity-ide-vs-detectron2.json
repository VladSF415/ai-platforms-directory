      "title": "Pricing Comparison",
      "paragraphs": [
        "The pricing models for Antigravity and Detectron2 reflect their fundamentally different approaches to accessibility and sustainability. Antigravity is completely free during its preview period, offering full access to its multi-agent orchestration, integrated browser automation, and support for premium AI models without any cost barriers. This free model positions Antigravity as an accessible entry point for developers wanting to experiment with AI-assisted coding, though future pricing after the preview period remains unspecified.\n\nDetectron2 follows the open-source model, being completely free to use, modify, and distribute under the Apache 2.0 license. While the framework itself has no cost, users must consider computational expenses for training and deploying models, which can be substantial depending on dataset size and model complexity. Both platforms eliminate software licensing costs, but Detectron2 users typically incur higher infrastructure costs for GPU-intensive training, while Antigravity users benefit from free access to powerful AI models during the preview phase."

  "verdict": "Choosing between Antigravity and Detectron2 ultimately depends on whether your primary need is AI-assisted software development or computer vision model building. For developers seeking to enhance their coding workflow with collaborative AI agents, Antigravity represents a groundbreaking approach in 2025. Its multi-agent orchestration system, integrated browser automation, and free access during preview make it an attractive option for teams working on complex software projects. The ability to leverage multiple AI models simultaneously for different aspects of development could significantly accelerate project timelines and improve code quality.\n\nFor computer vision researchers and engineers, Detectron2 remains the undisputed choice. Its proven track record, extensive model zoo, modular architecture, and production-ready capabilities make it essential for serious vision work. The framework's flexibility allows for both cutting-edge research and practical deployment, supported by Facebook AI Research's continuous development and a strong community ecosystem.\n\nOur recommendation: If you're primarily focused on general software development and want to leverage AI collaboration for coding tasks, Antigravity offers innovative capabilities worth exploring during its free preview period. However, if your work involves object detection, segmentation, or other computer vision tasks, Detectron2 provides the specialized tools and performance needed for professional results. For organizations working across both domains, using Antigravity for development infrastructure and Detectron2 for vision components could provide comprehensive coverage of AI development needs in 2025. Consider starting with Antigravity for its novel approach to AI-assisted development while maintaining Detectron2 for any computer vision requirements, as these tools complement rather than compete with each other in the broader AI ecosystem.",
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can Antigravity be used for computer vision projects?",
      "answer": "While Antigravity is primarily designed as a general-purpose AI code editor, it can technically be used for computer vision projects through its support for various programming languages and frameworks. However, it lacks the specialized vision algorithms, pre-trained models, and optimization features that make Detectron2 ideal for computer vision work. Antigravity would be more useful for writing the surrounding application code, while Detectron2 would handle the core vision processing. For serious computer vision development, using Detectron2 within Antigravity's environment could combine strengths, but Antigravity alone doesn't replace specialized vision frameworks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Detectron2 suitable for beginners in AI development?",
      "answer": "Detectron2 has a steep learning curve for beginners due to its focus on research-grade computer vision and modular configuration system. While excellent documentation and examples exist, newcomers to both PyTorch and computer vision concepts may find it challenging. Beginners might benefit from starting with higher-level vision libraries before progressing to Detectron2's advanced capabilities. For those new to AI development generally, Antigravity's more guided, multi-agent approach might provide a gentler introduction to AI-assisted coding before tackling specialized frameworks like Detectron2. However, for beginners specifically interested in computer vision, starting with simpler implementations and gradually working toward Detectron2's comprehensive features is recommended."
