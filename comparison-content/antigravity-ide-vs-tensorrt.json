      "paragraphs": [
        "Both Antigravity IDE and TensorRT are completely free as of 2026, though their pricing models serve different strategic purposes. Antigravity is free during its preview period, representing a market-entry strategy to build developer adoption for its revolutionary multi-agent technology. This free access includes all features: multi-agent orchestration, browser automation, live preview, and support for premium AI models. The business model likely involves future enterprise features or cloud services, but for now, developers get unprecedented AI coding capabilities at no cost.\n\nTensorRT has always been free as part of NVIDIA's ecosystem strategy to accelerate AI adoption on their hardware platform. The free SDK encourages developers to optimize models for NVIDIA GPUs, driving hardware sales and cloud service adoption. While the core TensorRT runtime and optimization tools are free, NVIDIA monetizes through GPU sales, enterprise support contracts, and cloud inference services. Both tools represent exceptional value propositions in 2026, offering professional-grade capabilities without licensing costs, though they monetize through different ecosystem strategies."

      "paragraphs": [
        "Antigravity's feature set revolves around AI-assisted development: its groundbreaking multi-agent orchestration allows different AI agents to specialize in frontend, backend, testing, or documentation tasks that collaborate autonomously. The integrated Chrome browser automation enables real-time testing and interaction with web applications. Live preview and design-to-code features streamline UI development, while full IDE capabilities based on VS Code ensure professional development workflows. Support for the latest AI models (Gemini 3 Pro, Claude 4.5, GPT-o3) keeps it at the cutting edge, with additional features like 3D graphics support, Git integration, collaborative editing, and voice interaction via the Wave 11 update.\n\nTensorRT's features focus exclusively on inference optimization: layer and tensor fusion reduces kernel launches and memory transfers; INT8 and FP16 quantization with post-training calibration maximizes throughput; dynamic tensor memory management minimizes memory footprint; kernel auto-tuning optimizes execution for specific GPU architectures. Multi-stream execution enables concurrent inference pipelines, while the ONNX parser and framework converters (PyTorch, TensorFlow) ensure broad model compatibility. Time-of-flight optimization provides deterministic latency crucial for real-time systems. These hardware-aware optimizations are unique to NVIDIA's platform and cannot be replicated in generic inference engines."
