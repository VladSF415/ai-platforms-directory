        "Stanford Alpaca is Stanford Alpaca is an instruction-following large language model (LLM) fine-tuned from Meta's LLaMA 7B model using a novel self-instruct methodology. It was designed to generate coherent and helpful responses to human-written instructions, mimicking the capabilities of models like OpenAI's text-davinci-003 but at a significantly lower cost for research replication. Its primary distinction was demonstrating that high-quality instruction-following behavior could be achieved with a relatively small model and a modest, algorithmically generated dataset, making it a landmark academic project for efficient LLM alignment.. It's known for instruction-tuning, self-instruct, llama.",
        "Aomni 2.0, on the other hand, is Aomni is an autonomous AI research agent that performs deep, real-time web research on any company or market to deliver actionable intelligence reports. It autonomously browses, analyzes, and synthesizes data from diverse sources, including news, financials, and reviews, into structured competitive and market analysis. Its unique value lies in its multi-agent collaboration system, which mimics a team of analysts to provide comprehensive, cited insights for strategic decision-making.. Users choose it for autonomous-research-agent, competitive-intelligence, market-analysis."
