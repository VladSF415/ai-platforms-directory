        "Fast.ai (ml frameworks) is Fast.ai is a high-level deep learning library built on PyTorch that dramatically simplifies training accurate neural networks. It provides practitioners and educators with simplified APIs, best-practice defaults, and state-of-the-art techniques like transfer learning, enabling rapid development of models for computer vision, NLP, tabular data, and collaborative filtering. What makes it unique is its 'top-down' teaching philosophy, prioritizing practical results and accessibility, allowing coders to achieve competitive performance with minimal code and deep learning expertise.. It's known for deep-learning, pytorch, transfer-learning.",
        "TorchVision (computer vision) is TorchVision is the official computer vision library for PyTorch, providing essential tools for building and deploying computer vision applications. It offers a comprehensive collection of pre-trained models, popular datasets, and image transformation utilities that are production-ready and optimized for PyTorch workflows. Its tight integration with PyTorch's core framework and consistent API design make it the standard choice for researchers and developers working on vision tasks.. Users choose it for PyTorch, computer-vision, pre-trained-models."
