        "Gemini 3 Pro (llms) is Gemini 3 Pro is Google's latest flagship AI model, launched in 2026 with groundbreaking multimodal capabilities. It achieves a 76.2% score on SWE-bench Verified (surpassing Claude Sonnet 4.5's 70%), features a 1M token context window with 64K output, and uniquely offers full native video processing alongside text and images. Its key differentiator is best-in-class reasoning combined with true multimodal understanding including video, making it ideal for complex analysis and agentic workflows.. It's known for llm, multimodal, video-understanding.",
        "Google Cloud Vision API (computer vision) is Google Cloud Vision API is a fully managed, pre-trained machine learning service that enables developers to integrate powerful image analysis capabilities into applications without requiring deep ML expertise. Its key capabilities include detecting objects, faces, landmarks, logos, and text (OCR) within images, as well as filtering explicit content and generating image metadata. It uniquely leverages Google's massive-scale, proprietary datasets and research to deliver high-accuracy, production-ready models accessible via a simple REST API, making it a top choice for enterprises and developers needing reliable, scalable computer vision.. Users choose it for image-analysis, optical-character-recognition, object-detection."
