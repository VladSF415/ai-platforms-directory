        "OpenAI Whisper (audio ai) is OpenAI Whisper is an open-source automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that transcribes and translates speech from audio across dozens of languages. It is designed to be robust to accents, background noise, and technical language, making it highly versatile. Its unique value lies in being a state-of-the-art, general-purpose model that is freely available for both research and commercial use, trained on a massive and diverse 680,000-hour dataset.. It's known for speech-recognition, speech-to-text, audio-transcription.",
        "Keras (ml frameworks) is Keras is a high-level neural network API written in Python, designed to enable fast experimentation and prototyping of deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly, modular, and extensible interface that abstracts the complexities of lower-level frameworks, allowing developers to build, train, and deploy models with minimal code. Its key uniqueness lies in its multi-backend support, seamlessly running on top of TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch, making it a versatile and framework-agnostic tool for the deep learning community.. Users choose it for deep-learning, neural-networks, model-prototyping."
