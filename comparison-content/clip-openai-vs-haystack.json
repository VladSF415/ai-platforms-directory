        "CLIP (computer vision) is CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) is a foundational neural network model developed by OpenAI that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision. Its key capability is performing zero-shot image classification by comparing image embeddings with text embeddings of various class descriptions, eliminating the need for task-specific training data. This makes it uniquely powerful for researchers, developers, and companies building multimodal AI applications that require flexible understanding across vision and language domains.. It's known for OpenAI, Vision-Language-Model, Zero-Shot-Learning.",
        "Haystack (ml frameworks) is Haystack is an open-source framework by deepset for building production-ready natural language search systems and question-answering applications. It enables developers to create end-to-end NLP pipelines that can retrieve, process, and generate answers from large document collections using state-of-the-art language models. What makes it unique is its modular pipeline architecture that seamlessly integrates with various document stores (Elasticsearch, Weaviate, FAISS) and supports both sparse and dense retrieval methods alongside generative models.. Users choose it for retrieval-augmented-generation, document-search, question-answering."
