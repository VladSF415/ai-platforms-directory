        "Google Veo 3 (generative ai) is Veo 3 is Google's state-of-the-art AI video generation model that creates high-quality videos with native audio synthesis. Announced at Google I/O 2025 and updated to Veo 3.1 in October 2025, it generates 8-second videos with synchronized dialogue, ambient sounds, and background music—all generated natively. Its unique value is best-in-class quality excelling in physics realism and prompt adherence, plus the ability to create audio-visual content in a single generation.. It's known for video-generation, text-to-video, google.",
        "OpenCV (computer vision) is OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a foundational, open-source library for real-time computer vision and machine learning. It provides over 2,500 optimized algorithms for tasks like object detection, facial recognition, motion tracking, and image stitching, with interfaces in C++, Python, and Java. Its unique value lies in its massive community adoption, extensive documentation, and robust performance across desktop, mobile (iOS/Android), and embedded systems, making it the de facto standard for both academic research and industrial applications.. Users choose it for computer-vision, image-processing, object-detection."
