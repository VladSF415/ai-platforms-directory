(2) Scalability—handle thousands of concurrent users, auto-scaling, 99.9%+ uptime SLAs. (3) Compliance—GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, industry-specific regulations. (4) Integration—connect with enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, data warehouses). (5) Support—24/7 dedicated support, CSM, TAM, professional services. (6) Governance—model versioning, explainability, bias detection, audit trails. Standard platforms offer core AI functionality but lack enterprise-grade security, compliance, support, and governance features. Cost difference: 3-10x more for enterprise plans."

Infrastructure: $50K-$500K annually (cloud, GPUs, storage). Team: $500K-$2M annually (data scientists, ML engineers, data engineers). Training: $50K-$200K (employee enablement). Total first-year cost: $1M-$5M for medium-large deployments. Ongoing: $500K-$2M annually. Cost drivers: Number of users, data volume, model complexity, and customization.

(4) Want managed infrastructure and support. Build in-house when: (1) Highly differentiated use case (core competitive advantage). (2) Strong ML team already in place. (3) Need full control over models and data. (4) High volume makes licensing expensive. Most enterprises buy for commodity AI (chatbots, analytics) and build for differentiated capabilities (recommendation engines, fraud detection). Hybrid approach common: use platforms for 80% of needs, build custom for 20% that drives competitive advantage."

      "question": "What security certifications are essential for enterprise AI?",
      "answer": "Must-have certifications: (1) SOC 2 Type II—audited security controls, demonstrates operational security. (2) ISO 27001—international information security standard. (3) GDPR compliance—EU data protection regulation (even if not EU-based, shows privacy commitment). Industry-specific: (4) HIPAA—healthcare data (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). (5) PCI DSS—payment card data. (6) FedRAMP—US government (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program). (7) CCPA—California privacy. Additional considerations: Encryption standards (AES-256), penetration testing frequency, vulnerability disclosure program, and bug bounty. Also verify: Data residency options (keep data in specific regions), zero-data retention (platform doesn't train on your data), and security incident history."

      "question": "How long does enterprise AI implementation take?",
      "answer": "Timeline varies by scope: (1) Proof of Concept: 6-12 weeks (validate feasibility). (2) Pilot deployment: 3-6 months (single business unit, limited users). (3) Production rollout: 12-18 months (company-wide deployment). (4) Full maturity: 2-3 years (multiple use cases, widespread adoption). Phases include: Requirements definition (1-2 months), vendor selection (2-3 months), procurement/contracting (1-3 months), implementation (3-6 months), pilot (3-6 months), rollout (6-12 months). Factors affecting timeline: Organizational complexity, data availability, integration requirements, change management needs, and security/compliance reviews. Delays common due to: Data quality issues, stakeholder alignment, budget approvals, and technical challenges."

      "question": "What's the typical ROI for enterprise AI projects?",
      "answer": "ROI varies by use case: (1) Customer service automation: 30-50% cost reduction, 12-18 month payback. (2) Predictive maintenance: 20-40% reduction in downtime, 18-24 month payback. (3) Fraud detection: $5M-$50M annual savings for large enterprises, 6-12 month payback. (4) Demand forecasting: 10-30% inventory optimization, 12-24 month payback. (5) Personalization: 10-30% revenue increase, 6-18 month payback. Industry benchmarks: McKinsey reports median ROI of 1.5-2x investment over 3 years. However, 40% of AI projects fail to deliver expected ROI due to: Unrealistic expectations, poor data quality, inadequate change management, and lack of business integration. Success factors: Clear business case, executive sponsorship, quality data, and cross-functional collaboration."

    {
      "question": "How do we handle AI governance and ethics in enterprise?",
      "answer": "Establish AI governance framework: (1) AI ethics committee—cross-functional team (legal, compliance, tech, business) reviewing AI deployments for ethical concerns. (2) Model approval process—require review before production deployment, assess bias, fairness, explainability. (3) Monitoring—continuous tracking of model performance, drift, bias metrics. (4) Documentation—model cards explaining purpose, training data, limitations, potential biases. (5) Human oversight—require human review for high-stakes decisions (hiring, lending, healthcare). (6) Bias detection tools—platforms like IBM Fairness 360, Microsoft Fairlearn, Google What-If Tool. (7) Explainability requirements—use interpretable models or explanation tools (SHAP, LIME) for regulated decisions. (8) Regular audits—quarterly review of AI systems for compliance, fairness, performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we need to switch AI platforms later?",
      "answer": "Minimize switching costs upfront: (1) Avoid vendor lock-in—use standard formats (ONNX for models, open APIs), maintain data ownership, build abstraction layers. (2) Contractual protections—negotiate data export rights, transition assistance, reasonable termination clauses. (3) Documentation—thoroughly document models, pipelines, integrations (enables recreation on new platform). (4) Multi-vendor strategy—use different vendors for different capabilities (reduces single point of failure). Switching challenges: Rewriting integrations, migrating custom models, retraining staff, potential downtime, and data migration complexity. Realistic timeline: 6-18 months for full platform migration. Cost: 30-50% of original implementation. Some enterprises maintain multi-cloud strategies or hybrid deployments to preserve flexibility."
