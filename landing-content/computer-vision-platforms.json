      "question": "What's the difference between image classification and object detection?",

Object detection locates and classifies multiple objects within an image, providing bounding boxes and labels for each (e.g., '2 cats at coordinates X,Y' and '1 dog at coordinates A,B'). Classification is simpler and faster; detection is more complex but provides spatial information. Use classification for: content categorization, quality control (defect/no defect). Use detection for: autonomous vehicles, retail shelf monitoring, security (locating specific items)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much training data do I need for custom computer vision models?",
      "answer": "It depends on approach: (1) Transfer learning (recommended): 100-1,000 labeled images per class yields good results for most use cases. Fine-tune pre-trained models on your data. (2) Training from scratch: 10,000-1,000,000+ images required. Only necessary for highly specialized domains. (3) Few-shot learning: Recent techniques achieve reasonable accuracy with 5-50 examples per class. (4) Cloud AutoML: 100-500 images recommended per class. Data quality matters more than quantity—1,000 diverse, correctly labeled images beat 10,000 poor ones. Balance classes (equal examples per category) for best results."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use cloud APIs or build my own computer vision models?",
      "answer": "Cloud APIs (Google Vision, AWS Rekognition) are best for: standard tasks (object detection, OCR, face detection), limited ML expertise, rapid prototyping, or variable workloads. Pros: easy to use, scalable, no infrastructure management. Cons: $1-3 per 1,000 images (expensive at scale), network latency, data privacy concerns. Build custom models when: you have domain-specific needs (unusual objects, defects, medical images), process high volumes (self-hosted becomes cheaper), need low latency (edge deployment), or require data privacy. Hybrid approach common: cloud APIs for generic tasks, custom models for specialized ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "What accuracy should I expect from computer vision models?",
      "answer": "Accuracy varies by task and data quality: (1) Image classification: 85-98% for well-defined categories with quality training data. (2) Object detection: 70-95% depending on object size, occlusion, and image quality. (3) OCR: 95-99% for printed text, 70-90% for handwritten text. (4) Face recognition: 95-99% in controlled conditions, 80-95% in the wild. (5) Defect detection: 90-98% with balanced training data. Factors affecting accuracy: training data quality and quantity, model architecture, image resolution, and domain similarity to training data. Always benchmark on YOUR data—published accuracy may not reflect real-world performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast are computer vision models (latency and throughput)?",
      "answer": "Performance varies widely: (1) Cloud APIs: 100-500ms total (includes network). (2) GPU inference: 1-50ms depending on model and hardware. (3) CPU inference: 50-1000ms. (4) Mobile/Edge: 10-200ms on specialized chips (Coral, Jetson). Speed-accuracy trade-off: Lightweight models (MobileNet, YOLO-tiny) are fast (5-20ms) but less accurate. Heavy models (EfficientNet-L, YOLO-large) are slow (50-200ms) but very accurate. For real-time applications (30+ FPS), need <33ms per frame. Optimization helps: quantization (2-4x faster), TensorRT compilation, batch processing. Choose based on use case: real-time detection needs speed, medical imaging prioritizes accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "What hardware do I need for computer vision?",
      "answer": "Requirements depend on scale: (1) Development/Prototyping: Modern laptop with GPU (NVIDIA RTX 3060+) or cloud notebooks (Google Colab, Paperspace). (2) Production inference (cloud): No hardware—use cloud APIs or managed services. (3) On-premise inference: NVIDIA GPUs (RTX A4000-A6000 for moderate load, A100 for high throughput) or CPUs for small scale. (4) Edge devices: NVIDIA Jetson (nano to AGX Xavier), Google Coral TPU, Intel Movidius, or Apple Neural Engine. (5) Training custom models: High-end GPUs (A100, H100) or cloud training (AWS, Google Cloud). Most teams use cloud for training, edge/on-premise for inference. GPUs essential for deep learning; traditional CV (OpenCV) runs on CPUs."

      "question": "How do I handle video analysis (not just images)?",
      "answer": "Video analysis approaches: (1) Frame sampling—process every Nth frame (every 5th, 10th) to reduce computation. Trade-off between coverage and cost. (2) Motion detection—only process frames with significant changes. Saves compute on static scenes. (3) Object tracking—detect in frame 1, track across subsequent frames (cheaper than detecting every frame). Tools: SORT, DeepSORT. (4) Temporal models—RNNs, 3D CNNs that understand time. Better for action recognition. Platforms: Google Video Intelligence API, AWS Rekognition Video, Azure Video Indexer for managed services. OpenCV, PyTorch Video for custom solutions. Challenges: storage (4K video = 10-20GB/hour), compute (30fps = 30 inferences/second), and maintaining accuracy across scenes."

      "question": "What are the biggest challenges in deploying computer vision in production?",
      "answer": "Common production challenges: (1) Data distribution shift—training data doesn't match production (different lighting, angles, products). Solution: Collect production data, retrain regularly. (2) Edge cases—rare scenarios not in training data. Solution: Active learning, human-in-the-loop for uncertain predictions. (3) Latency requirements—models too slow for real-time needs. Solution: Model optimization, hardware acceleration. (4) Scalability—handling millions of images/day. Solution: Distributed processing, efficient architectures. (5) Labeling bottleneck—getting quality training data. Solution: Active learning, semi-supervised learning, crowdsourcing. (6) Model drift—accuracy degradation over time. Solution: Monitoring, automated retraining pipelines. (7) Cost management—cloud API costs at scale. Solution: Self-hosted models, cost-accuracy optimization."
