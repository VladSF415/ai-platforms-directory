Ideal for learning NLP concepts and prototyping. spaCy is built for production use with focus on performance and efficiency. It's 10-100x faster than NLTK for common tasks. spaCy excels at: tokenization, POS tagging, NER, and dependency parsing. Choose NLTK for learning or research experiments; use spaCy for production systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I use cloud NLP APIs or build my own models?",
      "answer": "Cloud APIs (Google, AWS, Azure) are best for: standard tasks (sentiment, entities), limited ML expertise, or rapid prototyping. They're accurate, scalable, and require no infrastructure. Build custom models when: you have domain-specific requirements (medical, legal), need full data control (privacy), process high volumes (API costs become prohibitive), or require fine-grained customization. Hybrid approaches are common: cloud APIs for generic tasks, custom models for specialized ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is sentiment analysis?",
      "answer": "Accuracy varies widely. Simple approaches (VADER, TextBlob) achieve 60-70% on general text. Pre-trained BERT models reach 85-92% on standard datasets. Fine-tuned models on domain data can exceed 95%. However, sarcasm, subtle sentiment, and domain-specific language challenge all models. For critical applications, combine automated analysis with human review. Accuracy improves with: quality training data, domain-specific models, and clear sentiment definitions (3-class: positive/neutral/negative is easier than 5-star ratings)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What NLP tools work best for multilingual applications?",
      "answer": "For multilingual NLP, use: (1) Cloud APIs—Google Cloud Natural Language (100+ languages), AWS Comprehend (12 languages), Azure Text Analytics (120+ languages). (2) Multilingual models—mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa (100 languages), mT5 (101 languages). (3) spaCy—trained models for 23 languages. (4) Translation APIs—DeepL (31 languages, high quality), Google Translate (133 languages). For many languages simultaneously, multilingual BERT or cloud APIs offer best coverage. For high-quality single-language support, language-specific models excel."

(2) Hugging Face Transformers—state-of-the-art BERT-based NER. (3) Cloud APIs—AWS Comprehend, Google Cloud Natural Language provide entity extraction as a service. (4) Custom NER—for domain-specific entities (product names, technical terms), fine-tune models on labeled data using Prodigy or Label Studio. For documents (PDFs, scans), combine OCR (Tesseract, Google Vision) with NER."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best approach for building a chatbot?",
      "answer": "Modern chatbots use LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) for natural conversations. Architecture: (1) LLM for response generation, (2) RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for knowledge base access, (3) function calling for actions (API calls, database queries). Tools: LangChain/LlamaIndex (orchestration), vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate) for document retrieval, LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic). For simpler chatbots, use: DialogFlow, Amazon Lex, or Rasa. These offer intent recognition, entity extraction, and dialog management without LLMs. LLM-based bots are more natural but less predictable; intent-based bots are more controlled but less flexible."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I improve NLP accuracy for my specific domain?",
      "answer": "Domain adaptation strategies: (1) Fine-tuning—take pre-trained model (BERT, RoBERTa), fine-tune on your labeled data (1K+ examples). Most effective approach. (2) In-context learning—provide examples in prompt for LLMs (GPT-4, Claude). Works with 5-20 examples, no training needed. (3) Custom dictionaries—add domain-specific terms to tokenizers, use domain vocabularies. (4) Data augmentation—expand training set with synthetic examples. (5) Ensemble methods—combine multiple models for robustness. Start with in-context learning for quick wins, invest in fine-tuning for production systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the latest NLP trends in 2026?",
      "answer": "Key trends: (1) Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate—GPT-4, Claude, Gemini handle diverse NLP tasks without task-specific training. (2) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)—combining search with generation for accurate, grounded responses. (3) Multimodal models—processing text + images + audio (GPT-4V, Gemini). (4) Smaller, specialized models—distilled models (Phi-2, Mistral) offer good performance with lower costs. (5) Agentic AI—LLMs that use tools, make decisions, and execute actions. (6) Improved multilingual support—better coverage for low-resource languages. The field shifts from task-specific models to general-purpose LLMs adapted via prompting and fine-tuning."
