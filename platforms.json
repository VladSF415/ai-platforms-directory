It enables users to create, edit, and export annotations for computer vision datasets without requiring any installation or server setup. Its key differentiator is being a lightweight, purely client-side application that runs entirely in a web browser while supporting complex annotation tasks like polygons, points, and bounding boxes across multiple media formats.",
